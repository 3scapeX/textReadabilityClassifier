Gillian: Hey, Mum. You know it’s my birthday soon.
Mrs Collins: Yes, of course I know. What do you want to do?
Gillian: Well, I want to have a party with my friends.
Mrs Collins: OK. Your birthday is on a Saturday, so you can have a party then. 
Who do you want to invite?
Gillian: Well, there are 24 kids in my class and then there are 13 people in my film club.
Mrs Collins: Gillian, you can’t invite 37 people. There is not enough room.
Gillian: But Mum … How many people can I invite?
Mrs Collins: Well, let’s say about ten.
Gillian: Hmm, OK, so Rajiv, Charlie and Caroline, her brother George, Karla …
Mrs Collins: But remember, you have to invite family, too. Grandma Janet, Aunt Fay and 
Uncle Morgan, Aunt Alice and Uncle Thomas …
Gillian: And Cousin David … But Mum, that’s already eleven people. 
Can’t I invite the family some other time?
Mrs Collins: No, Gillian. I can’t organise two parties. So, what party food would you like?
Gillian: Pizza! And cake! And crisps and sweets.
Mrs Collins: Good! We can make pizza and I can make a chocolate cake.
Gillian: That sounds yummy. I also want to do something special. 
But I’m not sure what.
Mrs Collins: Well, what about a magic show? Uncle Morgan can do some magic tricks.
Gillian: Oh no, no magic show! Uncle Morgan’s magic tricks are really bad. 
Maybe we could do a rally around Camden or we could …
