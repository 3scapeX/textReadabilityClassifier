Caroline: Oh, hi Charlie, hi Gillian.
Gillian: Hi Caroline. Do you want to join a school club?
Caroline: I’m in the drama club but some of these sound good, too.
Charlie: Yeah. I’m in the Arsenal club. It’s great!
Gillian: No … The Arsenal club is boring. I’m in the film club. That’s fantastic.
Caroline: So what do you do in the Arsenal club?
Charlie: We play football! Sometimes players from Arsenal FC give us lessons. 
It’s fun and interesting.
Caroline: Mmh. What about the film club, Gillian? What happens there?
Gillian: It’s fantastic. We watch films together and talk about them.
Caroline: OK. But maybe I could learn to play the guitar in a school club. 
Rajiv plays the guitar, doesn’t he? Which club is he in?
Gillian: He’s in the rock and pop music club.
Caroline: Well, rock and pop music club sounds good.
Gillian: OK. It says they meet at 3 pm on Fridays.
Caroline: Great. That’s today.
