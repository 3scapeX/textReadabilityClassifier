Last Saturday was the first day of the summer 
holidays. It was warm and windy. Caroline and Claire had breakfast.

Claire:	Oh, I love holidays!
Caroline: Me, too. And it’s great having you here.
Claire:	Thanks. I can’t wait to see more of London and meet your friends.

Suddenly Caroline noticed a big balloon in the 
tree outside. She jumped up and opened the 
window. Gillian and Rajiv were outside in the 
garden.

Caroline: Hi, you two! Do you see the balloon?
Rajiv: 	Yeah, it’s really nice. Who does it belong to?
Caroline: I don’t know.
Gillian: Maybe we can get it out of the tree.
Caroline: Good idea! But first come in and meet my friend Claire from Manchester.

The four had a great time. They talked and had some more toast. After that they played Twister 
in the garden and laughed a lot. Then they 
phoned Charlie.

Caroline: Hey Charlie, why don’t you come to my house? Gillian and Rajiv are here, too, 
and my friend Claire from Manchester.
Charlie: Sorry, I can’t. I have to play with my sister Sharon. She’s upset. We were in 
the park this morning. She played with her new balloon for a while, but then suddenly …
Caroline: Wait a second! Is it a big green balloon that has a clown’s face on it?
Charlie: How do you know?
Caroline: Well, …
