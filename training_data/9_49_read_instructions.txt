The “four Rs”

ACT GREEN – THE “FOUR Rs”
Reduce
Reduce your rubbish! Choose things with the least amount of packaging. 
Don’t take plastic bags from a shop if you don’t need them.
Reuse
Think before you throw things away! Maybe someone else can reuse them. 
Swap or sell things such as toys, clothes and books – or take them to a charity shop.
Recycle
Separate your rubbish so that it can be turned into new things!
Used writing paper, for example, can be made into toilet paper.
Repair
Don’t just throw broken things away – try to repair them!
It can be great fun and it will definitely help the environment.
