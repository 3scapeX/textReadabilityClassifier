Working abroad

Summer job in small B&B in Brighton
I am looking for a reliable person to live with us for three months from July to September. The job involves helping to make breakfast for the guests, making the beds and generally helping in the guesthouse.
Working hours are 6.30â€“13.00, afternoons are free plus one day per week by arrangement. You will get full board and lodging plus wage.
You must be honest, reliable and polite. You must also be able to communicate with the guests.
The ideal candidate should be able to speak French or German, as most of our guests are from abroad, but this is not essential.
