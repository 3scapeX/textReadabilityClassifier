Four places – four things to see

Stonehenge
This huge monument in the south of England was built over 5,000 years ago. There’s also a legend that King Arthur’s father travelled to Ireland to take the huge stones to England. But the stones were too heavy. So Merlin the magician used magic to move them across the Irish Sea.

The Giant’s Causeway
It is said that there was a strong Scottish giant called Benandonner who laughed at the Irish giant Finn McCool. Finn got so angry that he built a causeway across the Irish Sea.

Loch Ness
The loch (Scottish word for lake) is famous for the Loch Ness Monster. It lies in a beautiful area with forests, moors and mountains.

Mount Snowdon
Mount Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales (1,085 m). Walk to the top and you’ll have some of the best views in Britain.
