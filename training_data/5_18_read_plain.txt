This is my room. I’ve got a comfortable bed. There’s a desk with a chair. I’ve got a wardrobe and a small table under the window. There are a lot of posters on the walls. I’ve got some shelves, too. I keep my books and games on them but there are always things on the floor. Sometimes you can’t open the door. My mother always says “Tidy up your room!” but I like it like this.
