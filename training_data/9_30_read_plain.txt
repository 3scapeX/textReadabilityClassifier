Typical high school groups

Preps
Why are preps the people we all love but hate at the same time? Preps tend to be the all-American girl/boy and will typically be concerned with the way they look. Expect to see people like them on the cover of a high fashion catalogue! They are outgoing and don’t have a problem helping those who are not so privileged – as long as it makes them look good. Whenever they need money, they just ask Daddy.
Jocks
These are typically muscular types who are sometimes also good-looking. Their entire world revolves around sports. What else makes jocks so special? They love what they do and are extremely confident despite the pressure on them. The whole school is counting on them to win that title! Jocks are also not exactly known for their intellectual interests. If they are good athletes, bad grades don’t matter because they will go to college on athletic scholarships.
Popular girls/Cheerleaders
These will be at the top of the social ladder as far as fashion and looks go. What they lack in brains they make up for in hair products. They gossip about anyone in order to make themselves look better. They are very outgoing and must always look like they are in love. Popular girls are involved in almost everything at school and often become cheerleaders. Cruelty is the order of the day with them, as beastliness and bullying are quite common. 
Geeks/Nerds
These tend to be the people who actually care about their education and are brainy. As a result they are outside of the ranks of popularity. They usually wear comfortable, casual clothes and don’t spend much time thinking about their physical appearance. Geeks are more likely to have a cooler character than nerds. They tend to be the ones who feel free to choose their interests from whatever they want, whereas nerds may be more fanatical about things.
