People and places – Youth cultures

There are many different types of youth cultures or groups today. Some of them started many years ago. Most of these groups disappeared again after a few years.
One well-known group that has not disappeared is the punks. They came up in Britain in the 1970s as a result of “punk rock”, which was a new kind of rock music at that time. There are still punks today, but now there are many different types.
Goth culture started as punk culture, but it has now become something quite different. Goths use lots of make-up and wear dark clothes, and many have special tattoos and/or piercings. They do this to shock or just to show everyone that they don’t have to do what other people are doing.
But tattoos and piercings have existed for thousands of years. At first they had special meanings, for example religious meanings. Then people had them because they thought it was a sign of beauty and strength. Today everyone has a different reason for getting a tattoo or piercings.
