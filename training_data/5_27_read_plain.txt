I am 11 years old and I live in Puebla in Mexico. I collect football cards. My favourite player is Mario Ortiz. He plays for Puebla FC. I like listening to music. My favourite band is called Mama Pulpa. I like ska music because it is fun and exciting. I am good at playing the guitar and I am in a band at school. It is called Puebla Heroes. I cannot stand pop songs but when we play rock or ska it is cool. I hate love songs because they are boring. I love dancing. Everyone dances in Mexico and when there is a party people always dance. I do not like shopping. I prefer playing computer games or reading.

I am 11 years old and I live in Jerusalem in Israel. I like meeting my friends. We often go to the cinema together. My favourite films are comedies and my favourite actress is Keren Mor. Watching TV is great, too (but I hate playing computer games). I also often go shopping with my friends. I love sports. I am good at volleyball and hockey and I go swimming once a week. I cannot stand dancing but I like doing gymnastics and riding my bike.
