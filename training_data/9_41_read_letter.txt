Dear Sir or Madam,
I learned from Ms Harper, the careers officer at Haverstock School, that you offer students the chance to do work experience at your company. I am very interested in installing and repairing electrical equipment and would like to apply for a placement in May.
I enclose my CV and the address of Mr Dixon, the owner of Gates DIY in Camden Road, London, who can send you a reference.
I enjoy working in a team and I have the stamina to finish difficult tasks. So, I think 
I would be an ideal candidate. I would be grateful for the opportunity to do my work experience with you. 
I am available for an interview at any time. Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully,
Kian Brody
