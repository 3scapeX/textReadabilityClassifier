Indian food in Britain

Many Indians live in Britain, so Indian food has become more and more popular there. You can find Indian takeaways or restaurants in most towns. 
In these restaurants you can eat all kinds of Indian meals, for example curries. The Indian curry is a meal with vegetables or meat in a special sauce. You eat it with rice.
A lot of dishes you get in Indian restaurants in Britain are a bit different from original Indian food because they are sweeter and milder. Traditionally, Indians use a lot of different spices, some of which are really hot like chillies. One very hot dish is curry vindaloo. Eating it can be a test of courage for some people. 
Vindaloo became very popular in Britain during the World Cup in 1998. There was even a famous football chant called “Vindaloo” because football fans ate lots of vindaloo with beer after the football matches. 
British people also eat many other types of Indian food, for example daal (lentil soup), naan bread (typical Indian bread) and chicken tikka masala. It is often just called CTM. There is a story that the British wanted some sauce with their chicken tikka. So the Indian cooks added masala, a sauce that has got yoghurt, coconut cream and many different spices in it. So CTM is probably the first Indian dish that started to make Indian food popular in Britain.
