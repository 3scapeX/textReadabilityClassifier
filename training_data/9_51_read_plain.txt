It is all about global warming

GLOBAL WARMING
The temperature on earth is controlled by the sun.
Rays from the sun are sent to earth. The earth is warmed by these rays as the earth’s surface absorbs the sunlight and heats up. For thousands of years, most of the heat went back into the atmosphere, so it didn’t become too hot on earth.
But now there are more and more gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Most of these “greenhouse gases” are produced by cars, factories and homes where coal, gas and oil (the so-called fossil fuels) are burned to get energy. The gases stop the heat – they trap it – so that it can’t leave the earth’s atmosphere anymore.
So more and more of the heat stays in the earth’s atmosphere. That is the reason why it is getting warmer and warmer on earth. This is called “global warming” and has bad effects for everyone. Scientists have documented the rise in average temperatures worldwide since the late 1800s.
Global warming causes climate change. As earth warms up, the oceans also warm up and sea levels rise. This may cause floods and the disappearance of land. Climate change may also cause the weather to become more extreme: heavier rainfall, more storms and heatwaves, etc. As the polar ice caps are melting, life for polar bears and other animals is getting harder.
