A friendly match

Red Noses for Charity
On Sunday the Haverstock Arsenal club played a friendly match against the students of William Ellis School for Boys (WES). It was a great day and the teams raised about £ 250 for Red Nose Day. Fans and friends paid to watch the match and see the players wear red noses.
The match took place on the William Ellis sports fields. When it started at 2 pm, the Haverstock fans were chanting excitedly “Let’s go Haverstock, let’s go!” After ten minutes team captain Charlie Batson scored the first goal. The Haverstock fans went wild. The WES crowd didn’t look very happy, but five minutes later Adam Perry scored a goal for his team. At half time the score was 1 - 1.
The second half didn’t start well for Haverstock because some of the players had trouble with their red noses – they kept falling off! Things got worse when Josh Chang from WES ran towards the goalkeeper and scored a goal. Shortly afterwards Thomas West, a player from the WES team, ran into Charlie Batson and knocked him down. The crowd cried “Foul! Foul!” but the referee didn’t listen. Charlie was able to get up with the help of a WES player. That was good sportsmanship! Charlie played the rest of the match injured!
There was more bad luck for Haverstock when WES scored a third goal in the middle of the second half. But Haverstock didn’t give up. There were only five minutes left, and the Haverstock crowd were cheering loudly when Nick Hull scored a second goal for Haverstock. Then in the last minute Charlie Batson ran forward quickly and scored a third goal for Haverstock! So the friendly match ended in a draw and everyone went home happy.
It was a great match and we were also glad to raise so much money for charity!
