The show was brilliant! I enjoyed every minute of it. It couldn’t have been better. The only negative thing was that lots of mobile phones were ringing during the performance.

This is the best show I have ever seen in my life – full of colour, surprises and the most wonderful singing and music. I can’t wait to see it again!

The singing, the acting and the costumes were great. But to be honest: The tickets are far too expensive!

Very disappointed! Very bad quality of singing, background singing not loud enough, cold actors, no feeling.

The costumes, make-up, acting were fantastic, the music truly magical! The whole show was amazing from beginning to end. I would recommend it to all ages (it may be a bit scary for children under the age of 9).
