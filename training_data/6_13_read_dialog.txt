Caroline: Hello?
Rajiv: Hi Caroline, it’s Rajiv. What are you doing?
Caroline: Hi Rajiv. Nothing special. I’m looking at some magazines.
Rajiv: Anything new or exciting?
Caroline: No, not really. But wait – here’s a page with horoscopes.
Rajiv: Oh, no! I don’t believe in horoscopes. They are for old ladies.
Caroline: Come on! What star sign are you?
Rajiv: Aquarius.
Caroline: OK. Now listen: This is your lucky month. Take part in a competition and you’ll get a big surprise.
Rajiv: Wow! There’s this maths competition at school next week. Maybe I should take part and I’ll be the winner. 
Caroline: Wait, there’s more. Your horoscope also says that you’ll be a very good boy this month. You’ll help your parents in the shop every day, you’ll always do your homework and you won’t have any problems.
Rajiv: Ha, ha, very funny! Now it’s my turn. I’m Rajiv, the best fortune-teller in the world. Are you ready?
Caroline: Yeah, tell me my fortune. Will I be happy? Where will I live?
Rajiv: Well, you’ll marry a tall, dark, good-looking man and you’ll have two children and lots of pets but you won’t have a pony.
Caroline: Children? That’s stupid. I won’t marry anyone. I’ll find a good job – I’ll be a doctor one day. And I’ll have a lot of fun with my friends.
Rajiv: Are you sure? I know that I’ll find a nice woman. And I’ll have a fast car. I’ll be a famous guitar player and I’ll be rich …
