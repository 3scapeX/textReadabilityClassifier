My room is a mess, a mess, a mess –
Then tidy it up, it up, it up!
There are books on the floor, the floor, the floor –
Then put them on the shelf, the shelf, the shelf!
There are clothes on the shelf, the shelf, the shelf –
Then put them in your wardrobe, your wardrobe, your wardrobe!
There are cups in my wardrobe, my wardrobe, my wardrobe –
Then take them to the kitchen, the kitchen, the kitchen!
There are towels in the kitchen, the kitchen, the kitchen –
Then take them to the bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom!
There’s a TV in the bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom –
Then take it to the living room, the living room, the living room!
There’s a schoolbag in the living room, the living room, the living room –
Then take it to your room, your room, your room!
My room is a mess, a mess, a mess!
