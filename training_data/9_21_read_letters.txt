Difficult times

– Boyfriend
I’m writing to you because I simply don’t know what to do. It’s about my boyfriend. 
We’ve been together for five months now and we really love each other. We spend lots of time together but I also like to meet up with my best friend, and he with his mates. When he is with them, they usually drink a lot and do all kinds of stupid things. 
A few days ago he told me that he and his friends had sat in front of a refugee shelter in the neighbourhood. They had fun insulting the refugees and telling them to go home to their own countries. Next time he and his mates want to threaten the refugees and even beat them up. When I heard this, I couldn’t believe my ears. I told him that refugees need protection because they have experienced terrible things and that they have lost everything. But my boyfriend, who can be so sweet and tender, just said that refugees are parasites. 
Please help me. What can I do? I don’t want him to get into trouble – and I don’t want to lose him.

Dear Chloe,
Finding out that someone close to you has different ideas on such a controversial issue can be hard. Sometimes people can form their opinions based on rumours, rather than facts. Often, people are also influenced by those around them. If your boyfriend is normally sweet and loving, he might feel that his friends pressure him into thinking and acting in certain ways. Violence is never the right way to solve a problem, and it certainly won’t help in this situation. Perhaps the best way to make your boyfriend understand this is by showing him, rather than just telling him. Many towns now hold activities to help people living in refugee shelters and the local residents feel as though they are one community. Perhaps you and your boyfriend should go to one of these events. That way, he could meet the refugees personally, and he might see that they are really just people trying to get by.
