Charlie: Hello?
Rajiv: Hi, Charlie, it’s Rajiv. Listen, can you come to my house on Friday after school? You can sleep here.
Charlie: Oh, yes. That’s a great idea. I can bring some cool music.
Rajiv: Good idea! I’ve got some new comics and magazines for you. And we can get pizza or falafel in Camden High Street and stay up late.
Charlie: Oh great. I can’t wait.
Rajiv: See you tomorrow then. I have to tidy up my room now.
Charlie: OK. Bye, Rajiv.
