Favourite sports

I like hockey
I really like playing hockey. It is my favourite sport because it is exciting and fast. I think that it is better than ice hockey because we don’t need special equipment like helmets or special clothes. I train twice a week. I enjoy playing outside. It is nicer than being inside a sports hall.

Skateboarding
I started skateboarding five years ago. It is a great sport because you can do it whenever you want. There is a skate park near my house and I meet my friends there after school. We practise different tricks and have a lot of fun together.

My first mini-triathlon
Last week I had my first mini-triathlon. A triathlon has three parts: swimming, running and cycling. It’s great fun because you do different kinds of sports in a short time. Cycling was a bit of a problem because my bike broke down in the middle of the race. I still did really well because I was the fastest swimmer. I can’t wait until my next triathlon! Then I want to do even better! Caitlin, 11
