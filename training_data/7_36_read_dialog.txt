At the café

Gillian: Thank you so much for coming.
Charlie: No problem. So, what’s the matter, Gill?
Gillian: My dad phoned me this morning. He told me that he is going to marry again – his girlfriend Ronda.
Rajiv: But isn’t that good news?
Gillian: No, it’s not. I don’t like Ronda. 
Caroline: Why don’t you like her?
Gillian: Well, when I visit my dad and Ronda is there, she always wants to talk to me and invite me to the cinema …
Charlie: But what’s wrong about that?
Gillian: Well, I wish she would leave me alone sometimes. She tries to be nice … but she’s not my mother.
Caroline: I think I know what you mean. It’s hard for both of you.
Gillian: I guess you’re right. But there’s something else: Ronda is pregnant.
Rajiv: But isn’t that great? I know you love babies, Gill.
Gillian: No, it’s not great. New woman, new baby – where do I fit into that life? I always wanted to see my Dad more often and spend more time with him but it wasn’t possible. And now I’m worried that Dad doesn’t want to see me anymore. You’re all lucky, you live with your mum and dad.
Caroline: Poor you. I feel really sorry for you.
Charlie: Cheer up, Gill. Everything is going to be OK. Why don’t you talk to your dad and tell him how you feel?
Gillian: But I don’t know how.
Caroline: Perhaps you could go out for dinner with him – just you and your dad.
Rajiv: That’s a good idea. Then you can …
