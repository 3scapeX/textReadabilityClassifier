The next day Gillian and Charlie came to wish Mrs Lambraki a happy birthday and to help Caroline with her birthday idea.

Charlie was the waiter and Gillian was the waitress. Caroline cooked a fantastic meal – chicken with cream sauce and broccoli – and George made a chocolate cake while the waiter and the waitress set the table. They used the best knives, forks, spoons and plates. Mrs Lambraki waited in the living room.

Then the waiter asked her to come to the dining room. Mrs Lambraki opened her children’s presents. She loved Caroline’s scarf and George’s flowers. But she thought the birthday card smelled of oranges.

Then the waitress brought the chicken to the table. Mrs Lambraki said it was a delicious meal – as good as in a top-class restaurant. Everyone was so polite! Afterwards Mrs Lambraki said, “What a pity I can only celebrate my birthday once a year.”
