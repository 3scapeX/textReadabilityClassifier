Charlie: Caroline, meet Fritz the fish.
Caroline: Hi Fritz.
Fritz: Blupp.
Gillian: Can I feed him, Charlie?
Charlie: Yes. His food is here.
Caroline: Can he do anything interesting? Our dog can do some funny tricks.
Gillian: Fritz only swims and eats. I think cats and dogs are more interesting. You can play with them.
Charlie: I can talk to Fritz. He’s very good at listening. And he’s really clean.
Caroline: Daisy, my rabbit, is not so clean. That’s why I don’t like cleaning her cage. And I can’t go for a walk with her but I can pet her. She’s so cute.
Gillian: That’s why I don’t like hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and so on. You always have to clean their cages. Can your dog swim, Caroline?
Caroline: Yes, he can. Patch likes swimming.
Charlie: Well, then maybe he and Fritz could become friends and go swimming together.
Caroline: Patch would like that. He’s great. He even goes to his basket when you say “Sleep, Patch.”
Gillian: That’s cool! Does he bite?
Caroline: No, Patch is a really friendly dog.
Charlie: What does he eat? Meat?
Caroline: Yes, he does. What does Mrs Killmouskey eat, Gillian?
Gillian: Cat food. But sometimes she catches mice. She can run really fast.
Charlie: I really like parrots. They only eat fruit and vegetables and drink water. 
They have nice colours and they can fly and …
Caroline: Hey, maybe we could go to the zoo tomorrow. We could ask Rajiv if he wants to come, too.
