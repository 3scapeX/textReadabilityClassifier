Home alone

It was Saturday morning and Nick was alone at home. He was bored. He knew he should tidy up his room but he turned the computer on instead.
Nick started playing his favourite game, Boom Trader. In the game a girl was hiding behind a secret door. She has to wait until the wild animals have gone, Nick thought. Then she’ll find the key.
Suddenly the phone rang. “Hello, Nick, it’s Mum. Are you OK? Have you already had breakfast?”
”No, not yet.”
“Then you haven’t seen my note yet?”
“No, where is it?”
“Nick! Are you playing on the computer again?”
“Computer? What computer? I’m tidying up my room.”
“Really? Well, don’t forget to read my note. It’s on the kitchen table. Bye.”
“Bye, Mum,” said Nick. He was really glad that his mother couldn’t see his red face.
Nick went back to the computer. Let me just open this door … now where’s the key? Oh no, there are some crocodiles around the next corner … Phew! They didn’t get me. Now I just have to …
Nick was playing really well and forgot all about his mother and the note. Then the doorbell rang. It was Nick’s grandmother. She looked at him and said, “Don’t tell me you’ve just got up.”
“Well, no. I just haven’t got dressed yet.”
“But didn’t your mum tell you?”
“Tell me what?”
“That I’m taking you out for lunch. Hurry up and get dressed. I’m already a bit hungry.”
Then Nick remembered the note. He felt really bad. He got dressed quickly and then ran down the stairs. His grandmother was waiting in the hall.
“I’ve put all the breakfast things in the fridge – and I’ve turned off the computer. Are you ready to go?”
Nick couldn’t believe his ears.
“You turned off the computer? You saved the game first, didn’t you?”
“Saved what, dear?”
