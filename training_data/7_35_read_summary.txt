Cast Away

Cast Away is an American film from the year 2000.
It is the year 1995 and Chuck Noland (actor Tom Hanks) is on a business trip to Malaysia. While flying through a terrible storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. 
Chuck is able to escape the sinking plane but then loses consciousness and is washed up on a lonely island. Packages from the plane also wash up on the island. Chuck opens them and finds a volleyball, a dress, ice skates and other things he doesnâ€™t need at first. A short time later he draws a face on the volleyball, calls it Wilson and starts talking to it.
Four years later a large piece of plastic washes up on the island. Chuck builds a raft and uses the piece of plastic as a sail. With the raft he overcomes the powerful waves near the beach and reaches the ocean. 
After some time on the ocean a storm nearly destroys his raft. The next day Wilson falls from the raft and is lost. Chuck loses his only friend. 
A few weeks later a ship finds the half dead Chuck, rescues him and takes him home.
