Wall-E

United States: 2008
Running time: 98 min.
Director: Andrew Stanton
The animated film WALL-E is set in the year 2805. The humans left earth a long time ago because their environment was so polluted that it was impossible to live there any longer. They went to live on a large spaceship called Axiom.
WALL-E is the last of a large army of robots whose job it was to clean up the earth. They were left behind by the humans when they left the planet. All the other robots have broken down and now WALL-E’s only friend is a cockroach. WALL-E spends his days putting away rubbish and collecting things he likes. In the evenings he often watches the romantic musical Hello, Dolly! on a video that he found among the rubbish.
WALL-E’s life is not very interesting until one day another robot – EVE – turns up. She is sent by the humans to check out if it is possible for them to return to earth.
Before EVE’s arrival WALL-E found a green plant. When EVE sees this plant, she wants to take it back to the Axiom as proof of new life on earth. WALL-E – who has fallen in love with EVE – follows her to the spaceship.
After living on the Axiom for hundreds of years, the humans have become fat and lazy. 
They don’t work and don’t even walk anymore. They only sit in moving chairs and watch TV, while all the jobs are being done by robots. But when EVE shows the plant to the captain of the Axiom, he gets active.
WALL-E, EVE and the captain manage to bring the Axiom back to earth. The humans from the Axiom are very happy to be back. They have learned that it is important to care for the environment so they start to clean up and plant flowers and trees immediately.
The film WALL-E shows what could be our future. If we don’t start to act green, we may not be able to live on earth for much longer. Although the film has a serious topic, it isn’t boring at all. It is funny to watch WALL-E doing his work and falling in love with EVE.
