I was a cyberbully 

CYBERBULLYING
Posted by Jeff – 14 October, 6:16 pm
I had heard about things that my friends were doing online. Really mean, horrible things. 
I never thought I would do anything like that.
Last Wednesday my friend Brian showed me a list on his social networking site. It was a list of girls in our school and there were some really bad photos of them, too. Then he asked guys from our school to rate the girls. You know, how pretty they were. Some of the guys wrote comments, too. I thought it was pretty funny so I rated the girls, too. 
We laughed a lot and thought that was the end of it.
The next day everyone at school was talking about the list on Brian’s site. He had sent it to everyone. A few girls were crying. They had read what the guys had said about them. 
I felt bad but I didn’t really understand until I got home. The guys had put my younger sister Sarah on the list, too. But they hadn’t told me. She was crying and wouldn’t look at me. She was really hurt. I felt so bad then. If something like this happened to me, I would be hurt, too.
If the person was standing in front of me, I would never say those things. I would never have called them those things to their face. I didn’t mean them. I thought it was just a joke. Now the head teacher is going to talk to Brian and his parents, and he will call my parents, too. Once you put something online, you lose control of it. You can never get it back. I learned that the hard way. I wish I had never seen that stupid list on Brian’s site.
