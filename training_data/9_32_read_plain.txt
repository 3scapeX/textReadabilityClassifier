Different kinds of farming

End Factory Farming
Small farms with chickens running around outside and cows grazing in the fields are mostly a thing of the past. Today most animals are raised on factory farms. 
So, what are factory farms? A factory farm is a big factory where thousands of animals are kept in small cages. The goal is to produce a lot of food as cheaply as possible to make large profit. This allows us to buy cheap farm products in the supermarket. But if you learn a little about the consequences of factory farming, you ask yourself the question: Would it perhaps be better to pay a little more and know that my meat, eggs or milk did not come from a factory farm?
Factory farming means a horrible life for the animals. They don’t breathe fresh air until they are taken to the slaughterhouse. They are given drugs to prevent illness, to make them grow faster and to keep them calm. Cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and other animals are kept in small cages or in crowded sheds. Often there is so little room that they can’t turn round or lie down comfortably. The high number of animals in such tiny spaces means that disease spreads easily and the noise and stink is unbearable. 
Factory farming is also harmful to the environment. The waste that comes out of these farms ends up in rivers and pollutes them. Last but not least, consuming the products of factory farming is unhealthy.
It is difficult to believe that there are still people who defend and support factory farming. How can an industry that is so harmful and so cruel continue to exist?
