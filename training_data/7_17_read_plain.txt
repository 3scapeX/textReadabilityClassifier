The London Marathon

On a Sunday in April one of the world’s biggest marathons takes place on the streets of London. Each year about 30,000 runners take part in the London Marathon. The race starts at one of three starting points at Blackheath and Greenwich Park. It finishes on The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace, 26 miles or 42.195 kilometres later.

The London Marathon is not only one race. There is:
The Elite Race: Women start at 9 am from the Blue Start in Blackheath. Men start at 9.30 am from the same place. The fastest men are expected to arrive at the finishing line after about 2 hours. The fastest women will probably need about 15 minutes longer than the fastest men. 
The Mass Race: This race starts at 9.45 am from the Red Start in Greenwich. Most runners find sponsors because they collect money for every mile they run. Then they dress up for the race. In this race fun is more important than time.
The Wheelchair London Marathon: This race starts at 9.25 am from the Green Start in St John’s Park. Wheelchair athletes from all over the world can take part.
The Mini Marathon: This race is much shorter. It is run over the last 3 miles of the marathon. More than 2,500 children (ages 11 to 17) will run in it. It starts at 11 am. This year the runners will collect money for these charities: The Children’s Trust and the British Heart Foundation.
