Nothing can stop Sally
Sally Brown from Belfast in Northern Ireland started running when she was 10 years old. She soon found that she was a talented sprinter. Sally was born in 1995 with problems with her left arm: It did not develop from below the elbow.
Sally has taken part in national and international competitions. In 2011 she won a bronze medal in the 200 m at the Paralympic World Championships in New Zealand. Since then her life has changed a lot. Training is much tougher and journalists want to know all about her.
The biggest event in her career has been the Paralympics in London in 2012 where she finished the 100 m final in sixth place. To prepare for this major event Sally trained six days a week. She ran three times a week and did fitness training. At the time she still went to comprehensive school.
The biggest sacrifice for her sport is her social life. She can’t go out on a Saturday night because she usually trains. She also has to eat healthy food – chocolate and other sweets are not allowed. 
It is hard for Sally to train and concentrate on her education at the same time. She hopes to go to university one day.
Sally’s dream is to become Paralympic champion. She wants to prove that although she is disabled, she can run as well as people who aren’t.
