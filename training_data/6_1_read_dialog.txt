Caroline: Hi Gillian. How are you?
Gillian: Oh, hi Caroline. I’m fine. How was your holiday?
Caroline: It was great. The weather in Greece was fantastic. It was sunny and warm and sometimes a bit windy.
Gillian: Cool. How long did you stay in Greece?
Caroline: We stayed there for two weeks − with my grandparents, you know.
Gillian: Nice. So what did you do?
Caroline: We went swimming in the sea. We also visited some famous sights, for example Delphi and the Acropolis in Athens. It was amazing.
Gillian: Wow. Oh, look. There are Rajiv and Charlie. Hi guys.
Rajiv: Hi Caroline. Hello Gillian.
Charlie: Hi you two. You look fantastic.
Gillian: Thank you. How were your holidays, guys?
Rajiv: Well, I didn’t have a very exciting holiday. I stayed in London. It was often wet and cloudy and I had to help in my parents’ shop a lot.
Charlie: Oh, come on, Rajiv. I was here, too, and we had fun. We played football in the park when it was sunny.
Rajiv: Yes, we did. That was great. We also went to the cinema and to a concert for kids in Hyde Park.
Caroline: But Charlie, didn’t you go to Cornwall? You sent me a postcard.
Charlie: Yes, I went to Cornwall. It was nice. The beaches were cool and I ate ice cream every day. We stayed on a campsite in a caravan – but only for one week.
Gillian: Well, I had a good holiday, too. First I went to Scotland with my dad. We visited the castle in Edinburgh and went on a ghost walk. That was spooky. Unfortunately it rained a lot in Scotland.
Caroline: Oh, that’s a shame.
Gillian: Yes. But I was lucky. I also went to Majorca with my mum. It was so nice. We stayed in a hotel on the beach. The weather was great. We went swimming every day and I met this really nice boy …
