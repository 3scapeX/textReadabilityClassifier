A Festival of Lights

Diwali is a five-day celebration in late October or early November. It is a festival of lights. The people celebrate the god Rama and the victory of light over darkness, of good over evil. Itâ€™s a time to visit friends and relatives, give presents and have fun. The lights, the presents, the sweets, the fireworks and the singing and dancing make Diwali a highlight for everybody.

In Britain the biggest Diwali festival is in Leicester. People set off wonderful fireworks and there is a big parade where young girls in colourful saris dance, sing and give sweets to people in the street. The girls dance for the goddess Lakshmi.

In Indian homes Diwali is a very busy time for women and young girls. They have to clean all the rooms in the house and then decorate them with fresh flowers and lots of little candles and oil lamps. They also make delicious meals and traditional Indian sweets.

During Diwali people send cards to their friends. They visit each other and exchange presents and sweets. Young girls and boys wear traditional clothes and perform Indian songs and dances.
