It’s interesting to see what school days are like in other countries. I go to a collège in Paris. This is a kind of comprehensive school that all kids in France go to for four years right after primary school (école primaire).
My school starts at 8 am and ends between 4 pm and 6 pm. We have a school cafeteria and I eat there every day. I think the food is OK. On Wednesdays school ends early – at 12 o’clock.
I think our teachers are quite strict because if you are even a little bit late for school, you get into trouble ...
Between the lessons we have a 5-minute-break to change to another room. You mustn’t be late for the next lesson. Otherwise you have to repeat that lesson another time. We also have two 15-minute-breaks and a long lunch break.
In our lessons our teachers talk most of the time and we take notes. Students don’t say a lot during the lessons. I like it that students in other countries are allowed to say more in class and can sometimes work in teams. But I prefer our marks – we have 20 (20 is the best, 0 the worst).
I like my school a lot. I can see my friends all day. But after school we have to do our homework. So there is not a lot of time for hobbies or other things. That’s too bad because I would really like to learn to play the piano.
