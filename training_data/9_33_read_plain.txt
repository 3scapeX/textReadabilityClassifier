Meatless Monday

The school programme Meatless Monday has existed in the city of Baltimore, USA, since 2009. Every Monday students have vegetarian dishes instead of meat for lunch. 
Why meatless? Some experts say that eating a lot of meat can lead to different illnesses like heart disease and cancer, whereas eating a lot of vegetables can help to avoid health problems. If we all had meat-free Mondays, we would help to improve the environment – and the living conditions of animals because there would be fewer factory farms.
The programme has been a great success for some time now. It is becoming more and more popular worldwide – not only at schools.
