Caroline’s family

Caroline’s father, Mr Lambraki, is an engineer. Two months ago he lost his job and is now out of work. So he does the housework and the cooking. He is looking for a new job, but that is very difficult. Every morning he checks the newspaper and searches the Internet. If he doesn’t find a new job soon, he will get really frustrated.
Caroline’s mother, Mrs Lambraki, is a nurse at Wellington Hospital. She works very hard, but she loves her job. Looking after the patients is something she enjoys very much. She is often tired when she comes home. If her husband doesn’t get a new job soon, she will have to work even more. They need the money for the family.
Caroline’s twin brother, George, is 13. He never cleans his room and he doesn’t like to help with the housework. Caroline often gets angry about that. After school George usually plays football or computer games. He likes football and his computer more than his homework. If he doesn’t work harder for school, he won’t get a good school report. But George doesn’t care.
Caroline is now 13. She loves her pets and her friends. She spends a lot of time with her best friend, Gillian. They listen to music together and talk about boys. But Caroline also worries a lot: What will happen if her father doesn’t find a new job soon? Will they move to a smaller house? Will her mother have to work even more? Sometimes Caroline is really worried.
