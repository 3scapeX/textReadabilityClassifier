Good for you?

Eat better food!
Start the day with a good breakfast. Some cereals with milk are healthy. But be careful: A lot of cereals have too much sugar. If you like yoghurt for breakfast, choose unsweetened yoghurt and put in small pieces of fruit or some honey. 
Eat five portions of fruit and vegetables each day. Green vegetables are very healthy, especially peas, beans, broccoli and spinach. Fruit is delicious but be careful with smoothies: Some of them contain a lot of sugar.
Sugary drinks are bad for your health – and your teeth! Drink lots of water instead. And don’t eat too many sweets. If you can’t live without chocolate, it’s healthier to eat dark chocolate.
