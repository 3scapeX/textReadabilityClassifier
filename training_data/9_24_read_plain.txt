Being different

I’m 17 years old and I’m from Manchester. Wherever I go people stare at me or shout nasty things. Especially children and old people find me scary. My aunt thinks I might be a little shy and might like to hide behind my clothes and my make-up. But she is wrong. The truth is that I like to provoke people and make them think.
I always wear dark clothes and a lot of make-up around my eyes. I’m proud of my long black hair and I enjoy wearing big necklaces.
Two years ago my best friend and I became goths. My parents were shocked at first. They thought I worshipped death and feared I might kill myself. But that’s not true. Goths only accept death as a part of life. Although I prefer dark clothes, I’m an optimistic person who loves dancing and going out with friends.
