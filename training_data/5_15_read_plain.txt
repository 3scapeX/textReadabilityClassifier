It is Monday morning. The first lesson on Mondays is history. The teacher, Mrs Hancock, always talks a lot. Gillian likes history so she listens to Mrs Hancock. History is Gillian’s favourite subject. She always does her homework. Caroline never listens to Mrs Hancock. She doesn’t like her lessons. She really misses her history teacher in Manchester. Charlie enjoys history but he is often too tired on Monday mornings. He usually draws pictures of his classmates or writes down football results. Rajiv doesn’t like history. He thinks it is boring. He loves English and he is very good at music. In the history lessons Rajiv always daydreams. In his daydreams he often plays the guitar on a big stage. “Hey, Rajiv! Do you know the answer?”, Mrs Hancock asks. Rajiv’s face goes red. “Er, no ... no miss, sorry ...” “Rajiv, you always daydream in class. I don’t like that!”, Mrs Hancock says.
