Josephine Cochrane

Josephine Cochrane (1839-1913) was a rich woman who often invited friends to her house for dinner. Afterwards she did not usually wash the dishes herself – she had servants to do that for her. But it always took a long time and the plates, glasses and cups sometimes broke. So she wanted a machine that could do the job faster and without breaking the dishes. She said: “If nobody else is going to invent a dishwashing machine, I’ll do it myself!” And she did.
