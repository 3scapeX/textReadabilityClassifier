Gillian: I like your room, Caroline. It’s nice. There are so many books.
Caroline: I love books. Fantasy stories are the best.
Gillian: Yeah, they’re great! Oh, you’ve got a football. Do you play football?
Caroline: Yes, it’s my favourite sport.
Gillian: That’s great. We all like football. We can play in the park on Sunday.
Caroline: That’s a good idea! OK, what about some music? I like reggae, 
rock, pop and hip hop.
Gillian: I don’t like reggae but hip hop is cool.
