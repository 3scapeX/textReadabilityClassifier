Coco12: I’m so fed up with my brother. He never helps at home! And he never takes out 
the rubbish. It’s his job, but he never does it. I always do it.
Batgirl: Can’t you tell your parents about him?
Coco12: I do! I tell them and they tell him to do it. But George, my brother, never listens to them. He only tells them that I don’t empty the dishwasher. That’s my job …
Batgirl: But why don’t you empty the dishwasher?
Coco12: I don’t like it.
Batgirl: So, what do your parents do when you tell them about George and George 
tells them about you?
Coco12: They tell us just to do our jobs.
Batgirl: So, why don’t YOU take out the rubbish and George empties the dishwasher?

JoJo04: My sister always tells me to help at home! But I don’t like it! And I don’t like her!
Robin:	Does she tell your parents about you?
JoJo04: She does. She tells them when I don’t take out the rubbish.
Robin:	Is that your job?
JoJo04: Yes, but I often forget to do it. And then Caroline, my sister, does it and tells 
our parents. But she never empties the dishwasher. And that’s her job!
Robin:	So, do you tell your parents about that?
JoJo04: Yes, I do.
Robin:	So, what do your parents do when you tell them about Caroline?
JoJo04: They tell us just to do our jobs.
Robin:	So, why don’t YOU empty the dishwasher and Caroline takes out the rubbish?
