At the carnival

Caroline, Gillian, Charlie and Rajiv love the Notting Hill Carnival. They love watching the crowds of people who walk, dance and sing in the streets of Notting Hill. They love listening to the singers and bands. There are a lot of dancers and brightly coloured floats which pass by in the parade – and many tourists who take photos. But there are also pickpockets who try to steal wallets and watches. The police put up posters which tell everybody to be careful.
Today is the Children’s Day Parade. The four friends watch it excitedly. They are waiting to see Charlie’s sister, Sharon, who is in the parade this year. There is a group of children dressed up as sunshine dancers. Behind them is a children’s steel band which is playing Caribbean music. Sharon and her group are close behind a music float. They have got colourful skirts and fantastic headdresses of flowers and feathers. The girls look like tropical birds of paradise. They are all dancing to the rhythm of the steel drums. 
When Sharon sees Charlie, she runs over and gives him a big hug. Charlie is so proud of his little sister.
