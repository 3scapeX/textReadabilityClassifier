It is three o’clock on Saturday afternoon. Gillian, her cousin David, her grandmother and her aunts and uncles are sitting in the living room. Gillian’s mother is putting food on the table. She has got a really nice chocolate cake.

Now Gillian’s friends are arriving. They are singing “Happy birthday to you”.
Caroline: Hi, Gillian, happy birthday.
Gillian: Hey, Caroline, thanks. Come in.
Charlie: Here‘s your present. It’s from Caroline, Rajiv, George and me. Hope you like it.
Gillian: Hi, Charlie, thanks. Hello, Rajiv and George.
Mrs Collins: Hello, children, nice to see you all. Too bad Karla can’t come.
Charlie: Yeah, she’s playing basketball today. It’s an important match.

The kids are in the living room. They are eating cake.
Mrs Collins: Gillian, can you give your friends some lemonade, please?
Gillian: Yes, Mum, in a minute. I’m just opening my presents – wow, “Morning Light”, the new “Threenight” novel. Thank you so much … and what a lovely card!

Uncle Morgan is doing some magic tricks. His wife Fay is not watching because he is not a very good magician. Caroline and Rajiv are dancing and David is singing a song on the karaoke machine. Gillian’s mother is answering the phone.
Mrs Collins: Gillian, are you coming? It’s for you.
