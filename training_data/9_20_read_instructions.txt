Staying safe online
Don’t post any personal information online – like your address, the school you go to, your mobile number or your email address.
Never tell anyone your passwords, only your parents.
Don’t befriend people you don’t know and don’t meet up with people you’ve met online.
If someone sends you a mean or threatening message, don’t answer. Save it or print it out and show it to an adult.
Never open emails from someone you don’t know or from someone you know is a bully.
Don’t put pictures or videos online that you wouldn’t want your classmates to see.
Don’t send a message when you’re angry. Before clicking “send”, ask yourself how you would feel if someone sent it to you.
Help kids who are bullied online by not joining in and showing bullying messages to an adult.
Always be as polite online as you are in real life.
