On one knee (Australia)
You need two or more players. Throw a tennis ball to each other. When someone drops the ball, you say “Down on one knee!” If the same person drops the ball a second time, then you say “Down on two knees!” If the same person drops the ball again, you say “Down on one elbow!”, and again, you say “Down on two elbows!”, and then “Down on your chin!”, and then “You’re out!” Remember you have to stay in the position you’re in to catch and throw the ball.

Lion and Mouse Tag (South Africa)
Stand in a circle. Two players are in the circle. Both wear blindfolds. One of them is the lion and the other is the mouse. The lion tries to catch the mouse. When the lion roars, the mouse must squeak. When the lion catches the mouse, the game stops. The mouse then becomes the lion and a new player becomes the next mouse. Then the game continues.

Chicken Market (Italy)
In this game one person is the customer, one person is the grocer and the others are chickens. The players who are chickens stand behind the grocer. They have to act like chickens!
The customer and the grocer say:
Customer: Have you got any good chickens?
Grocer: Yes, we’ve got some delicious chickens. Would you like to try any of them?
Customer: Yes, please.
Then the customer can go to the chickens and touch them and make any comments such as “this chicken is too old … too thin,” etc. If any chicken giggles, he or she is out of the game. Now a new customer starts. The game is over when there are no chickens left.
