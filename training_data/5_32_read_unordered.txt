A)
When the mouse sees the lion, it says: “Just wait a minute, with my teeth I can cut the ropes.” The mouse uses its teeth to cut the ropes and after a few minutes the lion is free.

B)
A lion wakes up because a little mouse runs over its face. The lion is angry and wants 
to eat the mouse but the mouse says: “Oh lion, please don’t eat me. If you don’t eat me 
now, I will help you whenever I can.” The lion does not really believe that the mouse can 
help it but it lets the mouse run away.

C)
“See?” the mouse says. “Now you know that a very little animal can help a very big animal.”

D)
Some days later three hunters catch the lion and tie it to the ground with ropes. The 
lion tries to break free but it is not strong enough. Then the lion remembers the mouse 
and shouts: “Mouse! Mouse! Come and help me! I need you!” The mouse hears the lion 
and comes as fast as it can.
