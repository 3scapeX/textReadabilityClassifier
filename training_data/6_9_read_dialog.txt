Charlie: Hey, what’s the matter with you?
Rajiv: I can’t stand my mum. It’s always: “Do this, don’t do that”. My mum has too many rules!
Charlie: My mum is strict, too – and strange. You know that she loves talking about healthy food. Today at lunch she said that salad is more delicious than a hamburger. I can’t believe she thinks that. Nothing is better than a hamburger!
Rajiv: Yeah, and all this stuff my parents say about school, for example that German is more important than PE. Or listen to this: My father thinks maths is the most interesting subject at school.
Charlie: Ha, ha! Well, let’s play football now and forget about our parents.
