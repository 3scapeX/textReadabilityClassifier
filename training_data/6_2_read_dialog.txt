Caroline: … Now what do you think?
Charlie: Great idea, but have you got everything?
Gillian: Have you got a chicken? Have you got any broccoli? And what about cream?
Caroline: Don’t worry. How much cream do we need?
Charlie: Hey, don’t ask us. You’re the cook.
Caroline: Well, let me see. Here’s some broccoli … and the potatoes are in the cupboard. But I can’t find any cream in the fridge.
Gillian: And what about the birthday cake? We need sugar, flour, chocolate, butter, milk and some eggs. How many eggs are there in the fridge?
Caroline: Well, we’ve always got sugar and flour in the cupboard. But milk and eggs? Let me see … No, we haven’t got any milk but here are some eggs … two, three. Are three eggs enough? Oops, are two eggs enough?
Gillian: Oh, Caroline! We need five or six eggs. And what about candles? Did you look for candles? Are there any?
Charlie: Not in the fridge!
Gillian: Ha, ha!
Caroline: I’m sure Mum has got some candles.
Charlie: Hey, why don’t we go to the Patels’ shop and buy everything we still need for tomorrow? I know that Rajiv is there. He’ll be happy to see us.
