Money matters

TOP TIPS for TEENS!
Budget!
Write down how much money you get every week/month. Then work out what you can spend. Make sure you leave enough for something unexpected.
Save!
Try to save the same amount of money every month.
Aim!
What do you want to save up for? Think about this every time you would like to spend money. Wouldn’t it be better to save for the thing you really want?
Earn!
Think about different ways to earn some extra cash. You could get a part-time job, offer to do little jobs for your family or neighbours, sell things at a car boot sale, etc.
Think!
Try to think carefully before you buy something. Do you really need it?
Avoid!
Don’t use credit cards and store cards – they often get people into debt. 
Be in control of your own money.
