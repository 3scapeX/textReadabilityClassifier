Caroline:
I love holidays! I usually get up late, then read and listen to music or invite a friend to our house. If it’s cold, I enjoy staying in bed all day. On a warm and sunny day, I meet my friends and we play outside or go swimming. This summer my friend Claire from Manchester is visiting me. After that my family and I are going to Greece to visit my grandparents. I’m really looking forward to that!

Rajiv:
Holidays are great! You can stay up late and play computer games. My favourite holidays are the summer holidays. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and go to the park. We usually stay in London because my parents have to work in the shop. Last summer the weather was really bad and I helped them a lot.
