Coco12: Hey, I’m still doing homework. Can’t wait for the weekend. Any plans yet?
KamaX: No, not really. My parents want to go to the Science Museum but I’d rather do something different.
Gi11i@n: There’s a concert at the youth club on Saturday. Seeing a good band would be fun but I think it’s only for people over 18. 
Coco12: I think so, too. Anyway, Mum said she’s got a surprise for us this weekend. Hope it’s something I like and not a party with boring colleagues from work.
KamaX: Don’t worry! I’m sure your mum’s surprise will be a really good one.
Gi11i@n: Yeah, absolutely. I’d love to do something cool this weekend but I’ve already spent most of my pocket money. I’ve only got five pounds left.
KamaX: I think I’ve got something for you and me, Gill. You know my grandma, right? She lives in a village north of London. There’s a car boot sale on Sunday. It’s always really big and you can buy lots of things for not much money. I could ask my parents to take us there.
