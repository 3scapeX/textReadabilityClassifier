Spending your cash

Kenneth, 65
Well, I started working when I was sixteen and that was the first time. 
I had my own money to spend.
I still lived with my parents at that time and they never had enough money to give pocket money to my brothers or me. I had to give some of the money to my parents for rent and food but I could keep the rest. I can still remember what I bought with my first money – a very cheap record player and a Little Richard record. I played it again and again. We always paid cash in those days. Cash machines didn’t exist. You took money out of your account if you needed some. I got my first credit card when I was about forty.
I think we had less money than the young today but we also had fewer and less expensive wishes. When I look at my grandchildren’s rooms, I often think they only need half of the stuff! I don’t think buying or owning things makes you really happy. Friends and a loving family do.

I had a lot more money to spend as a young teen. I got pocket money from my parents and I had a part-time job at the weekends. I used to buy a lot of clothes, shoes, make-up, DVDs – everything!
The big change came when I got pregnant at 16. My daughter is almost three years old now and the most important person in my life. Her father left me after her birth and I’m trying to take care of the two of us on my own.
I work as a shop assistant and have very little money. I need to pay for my flat, food, clothes, transport and so on. I can’t afford to save any money and I try not to use my debit and credit cards too much. I don’t want to get into debt! And I’m proud that I work for my money. I can’t understand the unemployed. There’s this family in my street – both parents out of work and they even seem to like it! At least, they’re not trying very hard to find jobs.
