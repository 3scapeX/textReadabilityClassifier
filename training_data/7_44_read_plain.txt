The history of …

There are over 3,000 languages spoken in the world. People can use a telephone or send an email to ‘talk’ to other people. But how did everything start?
In the Stone Age people lived in caves in large groups. They made sounds and signs with their hands. The sounds became words. In different parts of the world people made different sounds. That is why we have different languages.
About 5,000 years ago the Egyptians invented papyrus – the first kind of paper. 
They also invented hieroglyphics. These were special signs used in the first letters.
There were also other ways to send messages. People used smoke signals, flags or mirrors.
The first real paper came to Europe 600 years ago. People started to write letters that riders brought to the right address – the first kind of post. It was good but not very fast. It took two weeks for a letter to get from England to Italy.
In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Now people could talk to each other – even in different countries.
In the 20th century there were thousands of inventions in the world of communication: radio, cinema, record players, televisions, … And then the computer. The first computers were as big as a room. Now computers are everywhere: in schools, homes, hospitals, etc. We can use the Internet to get information from all over the world and send emails in seconds. 
What will come next?
