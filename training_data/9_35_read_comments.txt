In my opinion

My God, this story sounds horrible. Some of my friends say that animals eat other animals, so why shouldn’t we? Then I answer that most animals kill for food and couldn’t live if they didn’t. But we can.

Some reasons for me being a vegetarian are: I love animals. I don’t want to kill or hurt them. If I don’t eat meat, then the animals don’t have to be killed. Perhaps more people should think like me.

Oh, please, leave me alone with all this. I love meat and I won’t stop eating it. If people enjoy vegetarian or even vegan food, then please, go ahead. But people shouldn’t tell me what to eat.

Imagine you had to kill the animal you wanted to eat yourself. I think then most people would become vegetarians.

Vegetarian food is more expensive and more difficult to prepare. A family of five doesn’t have the money and the time to cook vegetarian food.
