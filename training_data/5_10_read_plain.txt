Welcome to Haverstock

Dear new student,

Welcome to your new school!

There are 100 teachers and 1200 students at Haverstock. The school has got five computer rooms and there are interactive whiteboards in all the classrooms. There is a big library with lots of books. Students can take the books home to read them. There are a lot of school clubs at Haverstock. Most students are members of one or two school clubs and we are sure that there is a club for you, too. Please bring every day: your schoolbag with a pencil case, 
two pens and pencils, a rubber and a ruler. You can also bring: a calculator, a dictionary, felt tips and a pencil sharpener. You have to wear your school uniform every day. Please come to Ms Langâ€™s office on your first day. She is the school secretary and she takes you to your classroom. She also gives you your Haverstock identity card.
