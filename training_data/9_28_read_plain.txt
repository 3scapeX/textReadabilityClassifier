A tattooist’s experience

In his small downtown shop, professional tattooist Graham Mills is busy at work. As a look into his portfolio shows, he has great skill. I asked him if I could see his largest tattoo and he showed me a picture of a biker with a huge dragon on his back. Graham’s craziest tattoo is a necklace he tattooed around a woman’s neck. “She said it would be one she couldn’t lose,” he smiled. When asked why he thought people got tattoos, he said, “Some get them because they like to provoke society but others just want to change their looks or show that they’re individuals.”
