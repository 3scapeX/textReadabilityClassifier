I won’t give up!

Leroy Haffner — Swimming is my life

Tuesday, 2nd September
Today I had to stop in the middle of training because my shoulder hurt like hell. I got out of the pool and told my coach. He said I needn’t finish my training and told me to go and see the doctor tomorrow. I don’t know how I’m going to sleep tonight − swimming is my life. What if I won’t be able to do it anymore?

So this morning I went to the doctor’s. The X-ray showed that no bones are broken. But the muscle is torn and it’s going to take at least a month for me to recover. It means I’m not allowed to take part in the Nationals at the end of the month. I hoped I would be able to win some races there but now all my dreams are ruined.

I’ve just come back from the physiotherapist. He has shown me lots of exercises and said that I should do them all three times a day. Of course I will − I want to be back in the pool as quickly as possible! I’ve always been a fighter.

Today we had the Nationals. I went to the competition pool to cheer on the other swimmers. My friend Michael won the 100 m Butterfly: my favourite event. I tried to be happy for Michael, but I hated that he was allowed to swim and I wasn’t. So frustrating!

After I was feeling down last week, I spoke to my coach. He said I needn’t worry because so many athletes are able to recover from injuries and win all sorts of competitions. Just look at Usain Bolt! In 2010 he wasn’t allowed to run for a month because of an injury, and two years later he was the fastest man in the world at the Olympic Games. Maybe I’ll be the Usain Bolt of the water!

Wow! The physiotherapist said I’m allowed to get back in the pool this afternoon. I’m only allowed to do light training but it’s better than nothing. I can’t wait to be in the water again. It’s time to start swimming for success − wish me luck!
