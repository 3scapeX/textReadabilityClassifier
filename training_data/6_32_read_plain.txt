I’m still angry. If I can’t wear my new jeans, I’ll phone Grandma and tell her about my problem. I guess she will say that I can come to her birthday party in jeans. Grandma is cool. She likes my clothes and sometimes gives me money for a new T-shirt.

But maybe I should talk to Dad first. He is often more relaxed than Mum. If he understands me, he will try to convince Mum that those ugly black trousers are not the right clothes for me.

If I have children one day, I won’t tell them what to wear. I’m sure about that. If they go to parties or weddings in miniskirts or jeans with holes, I won’t say a word. And if I earn enough money and they like music, I’ll buy them guitars and we will become a famous family band. I’m feeling so much better now.
