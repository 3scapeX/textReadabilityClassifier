Hi guys!
I’m writing this blog at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia – it’s the highest lake in the world! I’m on holiday here with my family. Yesterday something really mysterious happened.
Late last night my brothers and I decided to go on an adventure. Mum and Dad were asleep, so we snuck out of the hotel. We wanted to go to the top of Cerro Calvario, a big hill by the lake. On our way we suddenly heard strange and angry voices in foreign languages. We also saw the shadows of huge cats in the moonlight. We were really scared. So we walked quicker and quicker until we were at the top of the hill. There we found an old man with a white beard. He was looking over the lake. We told him about the voices and the huge cats but he wasn’t surprised.
“In the beginning,” the old man said, “the Gods gave the Inca people this beautiful place. But the Gods also said “There is one rule. You must not climb to the top of the mountain. A sacred fire always burns there.” But the Devil said to the people “Don’t listen to the stupid Gods. Go and find the fire.” The people believed the Devil and went up the mountain. But the Gods saw them and sent hungry pumas to eat the people. When Inti the Sun God heard about this, he cried and cried. His tears created a huge lake. And when his tears touched the hungry pumas, the pumas became stone. Only two people survived. They called the lake Titicaca, which in their language means “Lake of the stony pumas”.”
That was the end of the man’s mysterious tale. Together we watched the sunrise on the other side of the lake – maybe it was Inti the Sun God saying good morning! In the light of day we didn’t feel scared anymore. Now all that seems to be a very strange dream.
