It is Derek the dog’s birthday today. He is three years old (that is twenty-one in dog years!). 
He wants to have a big party, so he decides to visit all his friends to invite them.
First he visits Kate the cat. “Hi Kate! Do you want to come to my birthday party?” asks Derek the dog. “I’m sorry, I can’t today,” says Kate the cat. “I’m playing football with my brothers.”
Derek the dog feels sad that Kate can’t come. But he still has many more friends.
Next he visits Matt the mouse. “Hi Matt! Do you want to come to my birthday party?” he asks.

“I’m sorry, I can’t today,” says Matt the mouse. “I’m watching a tennis match on TV.”
Derek the dog is very disappointed, because now two of his best friends can’t come.
Maybe third time lucky! So he goes to visit Hannah the horse.
“Hi Hannah! Do you want to come to my birthday party?” asks Derek the dog.
“I’m sorry, I can’t today,” says Hannah the horse. “I’m going swimming with my dad.”
Derek begins to feel frustrated. Everything is going wrong.
Who are his other friends? Aha! Pete the parrot loves parties. Derek goes to visit him.
“Hi Pete! Do you want to come to my birthday party?” he asks. He is sure that Pete will say yes – Pete loves parties.

“I’m sorry, I can’t today,” says Pete the parrot. “I’m singing with my choir. But I do love parties.” Now Derek feels completely depressed. He only has one friend left: Lizzie the lion. Derek finds her a bit scary, but he visits her anyway.
“Hi Lizzie. Please say that you can come to my birthday party,” says Derek the dog with tears in his eyes. “I’m sorry, I can’t today,” says Lizzie the lion. “I’m … brushing my teeth.”
“Brushing your teeth?!” cries Derek the dog. “You can’t brush your teeth all day! Please come!” “NO NO NO!” roars Lizzie the lion. “It’s very important to have clean teeth.”
