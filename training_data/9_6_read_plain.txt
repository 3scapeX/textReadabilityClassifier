About a family

My grandmother, Rebecca, was born in 1890. She lived with her tribal people in the Kempsey area. Rebecca was the youngest of a big family. One day, when she was about five years old, some religious people came. They thought she was a pretty little girl, and they took her to live with them.
They didn’t look after Rebecca well. At the age of fourteen she had a baby, my mother Grace, and later three other girls: Esther, Violet and May. She married my grandfather and, at the age of twenty-three, she died of tuberculosis.
Grandfather took the four girls to live with their aunt and uncle. Grandfather worked and supported the girls.
One day a police officer came. He told my grandfather that the girls had to go to Cootamundra Home. There they would be trained to get a job for when they were older. If grandfather didn’t agree, he would go to prison and never come out. This was in about 1915.
My mother and Esther were sent to Cootamundra Home. Violet and May were sent to the babies’ home at Rockdale. Grace and Esther never saw their sister Violet again. She died of tuberculosis at Waterfall Hospital within two years.
Cootamundra Home was overcrowded and very strict and cruel. The girls were taught reading, writing and maths. They all had to learn to clean, wash clothes and cook.
My aunt Esther was a big girl for her age, so she was sent out to work as a cook when she was twelve. Mum, who was smaller, was forced to work as a nanny when she was fourteen. She had to look after four young children, one of them only a baby, for 24 hours a day.
