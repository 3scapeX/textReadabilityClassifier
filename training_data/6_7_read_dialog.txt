Gillian: Hi George.
George: Hi girls. Have you seen Rob? I’ve lost him.
Caroline: What? I thought you went shopping in Oxford Street together.
George: Of course we did. Then we took the tube to Baker Street. It was really full and when we got off, I suddenly couldn’t see Rob anymore.
Gillian: I don’t believe it! Did you phone Rob?
George: Yes, I did … well, I tried to phone him but my mobile is dead. I forgot to charge it.
Caroline: Oh great! Have you got Rob’s number?
George: Yeah, it’s here on my hand: 07700 900 325.

Rob: Hello?
Caroline: Hi Rob, it’s Caroline.
Rob: Caroline, where is George? I couldn’t reach him on his mobile.
Caroline: We’ll explain that later. Where are you?
Rob: I don’t really know. Five minutes ago I walked past a building on the left. There was a long queue.
Caroline: That was Madame Tussauds. So you walked along Marylebone Road.
Rob: Yes, well, then I turned right because I thought I saw George but it wasn’t him.
So I walked straight on to the next street and turned left.
Caroline: Can you see a street name? I’ve got a map here. I can tell you how to get to the museum then.
Rob: Just a minute, it says Nottingham Street and right in front of me is Marylebone High Street …
