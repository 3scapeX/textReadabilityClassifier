Adopt an animal

When London Zoo opened its doors in 1828, it was not like a zoo today. The cages were very different. For example, there were grass huts for African animals. Many of the 12,000 animals in London Zoo today were born in zoos. They do not know Africa, Asia, America or the North Pole. London Zoo also has some very rare animals: the Komodo dragon, for example, or the tiger and the Asian lion.
A zoo has always got money problems. You can adopt an animal at London Zoo for a year. For £ 20 you can adopt a guinea pig, a hamster, a mouse or a rabbit, a gecko or a small snake. You can share bigger animals with other people: the food for a giraffe is £ 1,500 – for a tiger it is £ 3,000.
