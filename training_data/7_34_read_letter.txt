A message in a bottle

55 Camden High Street
London NW1 7JH

Dear Finder, 

My name is Rajiv Patel and I am in year 9 at Haverstock School in London, UK. 
This letter is part of our science project to study oceans and learn about people in far away countries. 
Please send the date and location of the bottle with your address. I will send you my picture and tell you when and where the bottle was placed in the ocean. 

Best wishes, 
Rajiv Patel
