Sharon: Hi Dad. I’m hungry. Oh, is that bacon?
Mr Batson: Yes, it is. Can you help me with the table?
Sharon: OK. What do we need?
Mr Batson: Toast and milk and butter and …
Sharon: … and jam, marmalade, honey and orange juice.
Mr Batson: Do you want a sausage?
Sharon: Yes, please. Can we have baked beans?
Mr Batson: Yes, we can.
Sharon: Here are knives, forks and plates.
Mr Batson: Oh, good. What about spoons? Are they on the table?
Sharon: No, they aren’t.
Charlie: Good morning. Oh wow, bacon and eggs, and baked beans, too. Is this my cup?
Sharon: Yes, it is.
Mr Batson: Here’s the tea and the hot toast.
Charlie: Mum! Josephine! Breakfast is ready! Hurry up! We’re hungry.
