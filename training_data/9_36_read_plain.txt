Vegans

Vegan products have been available in supermarkets and restaurants since 2010. Europe’s first vegan supermarkets opened in Germany in 2011 – and in 2013 the Oktoberfest in Munich offered vegan dishes for the first time in its long history.
The term “vegan” has been around for some time, but what exactly does it mean? Vegans don’t eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, honey and all other ingredients which come from animals. Moreover many vegans avoid using products tested on animals as well as those products which are animal-derived, such as leather, fur and wool. Vegans want to live without hurting and exploiting animals. 
So what do vegans eat? They eat vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, nuts and seeds. Many vegan versions of familiar foods are available, for example soy hot dogs, tofu lasagne, soy ice cream and vegetable burgers. The “meat” in these dishes is called mock meat and is often made from plant protein. With the right spices it tastes very much like real meat.
