Slip – slop – slap

In the summer months Australia is closer to the sun than Europe during its summer. As the sun can be really bad for your skin, Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. 
SLIP on a shirt or other protective clothes. 
SLOP on sunscreen. When you’re at the beach or any place near water, be sure your sunscreen is water-resistant. 
SLAP on a hat to protect your face, head, ears and neck. 
SEEK some shade. It’s one of the best ways to protect yourself from the sun. 
SLIDE on some sunglasses to protect your eyes.
