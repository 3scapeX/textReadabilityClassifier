Paper plane

Fold a piece of A4 paper in half.
Now open the paper again and fold the corners like this.
Fold again to the centre line.
Turn the plane over. Fold it along the centre line so that the sides are together.
Make a mark 3 cm from the bottom line. Draw a line to the tip. Stick the bottom parts together.
Fold the first wing down along the line.
Do the same with the other wing. Make small cuts in both wings.
Open the plane. Bend the flaps up or down. Now you are ready to fly!
