Last Wednesday Sam was at Kentish Town City Farm. The farm opened at 9 in the morning, the weather was nice and Sam walked around the farm in his red sweatshirt. First he looked at his favourite animals, the pigs. Then he helped to feed the chickens. After that he walked to the cows. He noticed a bull among them. The bull looked at Sam and wanted to attack him. Maybe it didn’t like Sam’s red sweatshirt. Sam panicked and jumped into the river. He was lucky: The ducks didn’t bite him and a boy helped him out of the water.
