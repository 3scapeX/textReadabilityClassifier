Dear Nina,

Thanks so much for your letter! It was great to read about your school.

You asked me about classroom rules at Haverstock. There are lots of rules! First of all, we are not allowed to put our bags and blazers on the tables. That is OK because the desks are small. Then we are not allowed to eat or drink. Only water is allowed. We are also not allowed to chew gum in the classroom. I don’t really understand that because chewing gum helps me to concentrate. Sometimes I do chew gum and then my teacher says: “Caroline, chewing gum is against the classroom rules. Please take out your gum and put it in the bin. This is your first warning.” If you get three warnings, the teacher can send you outside to “cool down”. But you needn’t stay outside for more than two minutes.

We must wear the correct school uniform, of course. I don’t really like the colour black or dark blue. I wish I could wear regular clothes like you in Hamburg. But I’m glad we needn’t wear those ugly dresses we had in primary school.

In the lessons we must listen to the teachers and do what they tell us to do. If we want to say something, we must put our hands up. That is OK and I guess it’s the same at your school. Oh, and I nearly forgot: We are not allowed to use swearwords. What a stupid rule!

What classroom rules are there at your school?
Hope to hear from you soon.

Love,
Caroline
