A special supermarket

While preparing a meal together, two women from Berlin became aware of all the packaging they had brought home from the supermarket. Most of the food was wrapped in plastic or came in plastic containers. That night, while enjoying the food, the two women decided to start a shop where food could be bought without packaging. 
In 2014 they opened their first small supermarket in Berlin and called it 
‘Original Unverpackt’ (Originally Unpacked). The shop sells fruit, vegetables and bakery products as well as dry and liquid goods. Dry goods such as pasta, rice, cereal and nuts are sold in bulk from gravity bin dispensers. Liquid goods such as juice, alcohol, oils and yoghurt are sold in returnable bottles or jars. 
The customers bring their own containers and bags. Before the costumers fill their containers, these are weighed in the shop. Consequently, customers pay by weight of the products minus the weight of their containers.
With their supermarket the founders of ‘Original Unverpackt’ try to combat the global waste problem. In Great Britain and Germany alone, millions of tons of packaging waste are generated each year. Packaging is a very serious problem for the environment, in particular plastic bags, which take as long as 500 years to decompose on a rubbish heap.
Business is going very well at ‘Original Unverpackt’ in Berlin and their two founders are positive that others will follow their example.
