Typical high school groups

Preps
Preps are the all-American girl/boy and are very concerned with the way they look. They could be on the cover of a high fashion catalogue! They are outgoing and don’t have a problem helping people who are not so privileged – as long as it makes them look good. Whenever they need money, they just ask Daddy.
Jocks
Jocks are muscular types, who are sometimes also good-looking. Everything they think or do has to do with sports. What else makes jocks so special? They love what they do and are extremely confident. If they are good athletes, bad grades don’t matter because they will go to college on athletic scholarships.
Popular girls/Cheerleaders
These students are famous for their fashion and looks. They gossip about anyone in order to make themselves look better. They are very outgoing and must always look like they are in love. Popular girls are involved in almost everything at school and often become cheerleaders. 
Geeks/Nerds
These are the people who care about their education and are brainy. They usually wear comfortable, casual clothes and don’t spend much time thinking about how they look. Geeks are more likely to have a cooler character than nerds. They feel free to choose their interests from whatever they want, whereas nerds may be more fanatical about things.
