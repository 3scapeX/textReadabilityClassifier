Christmas

About a week before Christmas we buy a Christmas tree. We put it up in our living room and decorate it. We also write Christmas cards and send them to friends and relatives. We hang the cards we get on our living room door or put them on the mantelpiece.

The 24th December, Christmas Eve, is a normal working day. In the evening we put mince pies for Father Christmas and some carrots for his reindeer in front of the chimney. We also put presents under the Christmas tree and hang stockings from the mantelpiece. When Father Christmas comes through the chimney at night, he puts the presents for the children in their stockings. 

On Christmas Day, the 25th December, my little brother Josh and I open our presents in the morning. There is always a big family meal, it’s usually turkey for lunch. Everyone gets a Christmas cracker that you pull open with your neighbour. In our crackers there are some small plastic toys and a paper crown. Then everyone wears the paper crown on their head – it looks really funny. We play lots of silly games and have a great time.

The 26th December is also a holiday. It is called Boxing Day because on that day the rich people gave the poor people boxes of food. On this day we always have the leftovers from the Christmas meal, go for a walk and visit relatives.
