Spending your cash

Ruth, 34
When I was 23, I started working in an advertising agency. The job was stressful but I loved it. I worked very long hours and earned good money. At the weekends I went to parties or flew to Paris, Rome or Barcelona to shop for clothes. I was a young urban professional. I was self-confident and friends and family admired me for what I had achieved.
Things started to change in my fifth year at the agency. Our most important client, a car manufacturer, terminated cooperation. As a consequence, three colleagues had to leave the agency and the remaining colleagues, including me, had to work even harder. The atmosphere changed because people were stressed. I slept badly, often had headaches and dragged myself to work. Then one day the agency closed down and I was out of work. 
I didn’t have the strength to look for a new job – and I already knew at the time that I didn’t want to work in an advertising agency again. My life changed completely: I moved into a cheaper flat, I had no more money to spend on holiday trips or expensive clothes and I suddenly had lots of time.
When I felt better again, I tried to find a new job. I sent out lots of applications but I wasn’t successful. After two years without a job I finally found employment with a publishing company in another town. I earn less money than before but I’m grateful for the new job and I’m happy again. I love spending money on things I couldn’t afford when I was out of work. But still, I’m careful not to spend too much because you never know.
