Gillian: Oh, I can’t stand it. My mum always tells me to empty the dishwasher. I always tidy up my room and make my bed. I usually tidy up the kitchen in the morning and I sometimes 
take out the rubbish.
Rajiv: That’s not too bad. I usually do the shopping and I clean the bathroom. And I often wash my father’s car.
Gillian: Yeah, you’re right, it’s not too bad. My mother always does the cooking and the shopping. And I never wash her car.
Rajiv: Hey Charlie. Do you have to do any jobs at home?
Charlie: No, not really. I sometimes tidy up my room. But not too often … My sister Sharon tidies up her room every day.
Gillian: Rajiv does the shopping and cleans the bathroom and washes his father’s car! And I tidy up my room and take out the rubbish and …
Charlie: Wow! Well, I sometimes make breakfast – and I always feed my goldfish!
