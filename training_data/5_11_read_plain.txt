Murat

I am 11 and I live in Istanbul, in Turkey. My favourite subjects at school are biology and chemistry because I like learning about nature. I also like maths but I hate 
history.For the holidays we often go to Trabzon near the Black Sea. My grandma and five of my cousins live there. I always look forward to going to Trabzon because I have so much fun with my cousins. We go swimming in the sea, sometimes we go fishing and in the evenings we have a big dinner. We often have fish and vegetables. At home I like playing football, I often play with my friends. I also enjoy reading science fiction and comic books. My favourite author is Terry Pratchett. I am a member of the Terry Pratchett Internet fan club and I love talking to other fans online. I like all sorts of music, especially funk and hip hop. I do not like classical music. I think it is boring. I like watching thrillers but comedies are OK, too.
