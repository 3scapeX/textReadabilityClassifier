At Haverstock we have got assembly every Monday – all the kids in my year meet in the gym and our headteacher and the other teachers tell us about school projects, sports events, school clubs or plans for the school. Our teachers have got their own rooms. They always teach in the same room and the students come to the teacher’s room. There are a lot of clubs at my school. You can do sports, play an instrument, play chess and many more things.
