Teen courts

Teen Courts
Young people help young people
Teen courts started more than 30 years ago. Today, over 1,250 can be found all over America. These courts are for teenagers who have committed small crimes and have been caught for the first time.
The idea behind the teen courts is that teenagers may be helped more if they are punished by other teenagers and not by adults. This is why the judge, jury, prosecutor and lawyers in the teen courts are all teenagers.
Years ago, teenagers who committed a crime had to appear before a traditional juvenile court. With a criminal record it was then difficult for them to find a job.
Now young criminals get a second chance. If they admit that they have done wrong – and if it happened for the first time – they can appear before a teen court. The judge and the lawyers are all young people who learned how to do the job in training courses.
Among the offences are:
– stealing or shoplifting (less than $100)
– smoking in public places
– drinking alcohol
– driving offences or
– bullying
Sometimes there are teenagers in the jury who were criminals themselves. Serving as a juror can be a sentence. Other sentences can be, for example:
– paying back stolen money
– making an apology
– doing community service
– writing an essay
Many of the young offenders must take part in a program to help change their behaviour, for example anti-alcohol or anti-aggression training.
The courts are a success. Statistics show that only 9% of teenagers who appear before a teen court commit another offence. If they do, they are sent to a traditional juvenile court. The other 91% have learned a lesson and often, after they have served on a jury and taken part in a training course, become judges or lawyers in the teen courts so that they can help others.
