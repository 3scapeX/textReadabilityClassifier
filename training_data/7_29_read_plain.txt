At the carnival

It is a hot Sunday in August. Caroline, Gillian, Charlie and Rajiv are in Notting Hill for the famous carnival. The streets are packed with people who walk, dance and sing. There are many tourists who take photos of the singers, bands, dancers – and the brightly coloured floats which pass by in the parade. But there are also pickpockets who try to steal wallets, watches and mobile phones. The police put up posters which tell everybody to be careful.
Today is the Children’s Day Parade. The friends are watching it excitedly. They are waiting to see Charlie’s sister, Sharon, who is in the parade this year.
“Hey, guys, have you seen any pickpockets yet?” asks Rajiv and points to a police poster. 
“I haven’t got time to watch out for pickpockets,” says Charlie. He doesn’t want to miss Sharon on her big day.
There is a group of children dressed up as sunshine dancers. Their faces are painted yellow. 
Behind them is a children’s steel band which is playing Caribbean music. The air is full of excitement.
“Guess who’s in a steel band this year!” says Gillian to the others.
“Who?” asks Caroline.
“Look and see if you can find him,” answers Gillian. 
“Oh, wow, it’s Nick. Nick’s in a steel band? I didn’t know he could play the steel drums,” says Rajiv. They all wave at Nick and he smiles – he can’t wave when he’s playing!
Sharon and her group are performing close behind a music float. They are wearing colourful skirts, gold bracelets, and fantastic headdresses of flowers and feathers. The girls look like tropical birds of paradise. They are all dancing to the rhythm of the steel drums, and the crowd loves it.
“Sharon! Over here, Sharon!” shouts Charlie.
When Sharon sees Charlie, she runs over and gives him a big hug. Charlie is so proud of his little sister. She looks amazing and is really great at dancing.
