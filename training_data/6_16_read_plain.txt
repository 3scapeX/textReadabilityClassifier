I love science fiction stories. They’re really good adventure stories. I’d like to be an astronaut and fly in a spaceship. It won’t be an easy life because astronauts live dangerously. I’d like to explore the universe, find new planets and meet strange aliens. Astronauts like Buzz Aldrin are my heroes.

I’ve got two big heroes. The first is Tarzan. He lived in Africa and protected the jungle and the animals in it. Well, in books and films he did. There are lots of real people who really do that. I’d like to live in a rainforest in South America when I grow up. Then I can protect the rainforest, too. My second hero is Terry Pratchett. He’s an author and he writes the best books in the world. When I started school, I didn’t like reading. But then I discovered his books and became a big fan.

I’ve got two heroes and they’re both real. One of them is Amelia Earhart. She was a pilot in the 1930s. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the Pacific. She was very brave. My other hero is my aunt Ulrike. She is a nurse and works in a children’s hospital. She looks after kids who are seriously ill. Although it’s a really hard job, Ulrike loves doing it.

I’m a sports fan. I enjoy skateboarding, riding my bike and swimming. I also play basketball a lot and often watch it on TV. There are lots of great American basketball players but my favourite player is Vitaly Fridzon. He’s from Russia and with his team he won the bronze medal in the London 2012 Olympic Games. So I think Vitaly Fridzon is a kind of hero for me.
