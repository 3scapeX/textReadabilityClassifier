A special day

A great day for charity
On Friday 15th March teachers and students in our school raised money for charity. Students could choose certain rules to break on this day only. But they had to pay £ 2 for each rule they wanted to break. 
Many students chose to have crazy hair, wear their own clothes, eat unhealthy food during the breaks or not do their homework for the following Monday. 
A huge thank you to all who helped to make this Red Nose Day a very special day and raise over £ 900 for charity!
