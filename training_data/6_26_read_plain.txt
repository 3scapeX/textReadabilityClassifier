1. We get new clothes for presents. We usually get up at six o’clock and then we go to the temple. We always wear our colourful new birthday clothes. In the afternoon our family eats a birthday meal: a delicious curry and a sweet rice pudding.

2. My birthday is in December. I often go to the beach with my friends. We go surfing or swimming. I usually get my presents then. Or we have a barbecue in the garden and play fun games. Young children often eat “fairy bread” at their birthday parties. “Fairy bread” is white bread with hundreds of colourful sprinkles on it. It’s yummy!

3. In my country we usually don’t have birthday parties with cakes and presents because it is not a tradition to celebrate birthdays. In fact, some people do not celebrate their birthdays until they turn 60! But we often eat long noodles on our birthdays – long noodles for a long life!

4. I usually invite lots of friends and have a big party. There is always a piñata with lots of sweets and other nice things in it. And I have to eat birthday cake without using my hands – it’s a big mess but it’s very funny for everybody!

5. When we have our birthdays, we get small presents at school. Teachers often give students flowers, pencils or books. After school we usually have a birthday party at home. We play a game where prizes hang down from a rope. Each guest can cut down a prize and take it home.
