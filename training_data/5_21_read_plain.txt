Hi,
I am Rajiv. I am from Camden. Camden is in North London. On my street, Camden High Street, there are a lot of cars and buses. There are no trees and there is no playground but there are a lot of shops and restaurants. My parents have got a small shop here, too. They sell lots of things, for example Indian food. I sometimes help in the shop. Our house is small but nice. It has got three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom and a small and quiet garden. Our neighbours are friendly. Near my street there is a cinema, a sports centre and the famous Camden Market where you can buy lots of things. I also like my area because my friends live here. My best friend, Charlie, is coming to my house tomorrow. :-))
