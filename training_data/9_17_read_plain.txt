People and places – Binge drinking

In Britain excessive drinking is a big problem. In particular girls and young women – a group who used to drink less than men – have started drinking too much alcohol.
When someone drinks a lot of alcohol in a short time, this is known as “binge drinking”. UK teens are among the worst binge drinkers in the EU. 
It is common to see many young people out on a Friday or Saturday night clubbing. This is when the most alcohol is consumed, and ambulances are often needed for those who go too far with their drinking.
