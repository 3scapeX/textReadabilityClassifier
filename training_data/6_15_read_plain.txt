BANG! Cerys looked at her timewatch. Year 3013. She looked around excitedly. Where were the robots, the spaceships, the aliens in silver clothes? She felt disappointed – there weren’t any. She was in a strange, quiet forest. Each tree was taller than a skyscraper and there were tree houses on each one. Hundreds of long thin wires went between the houses. Suddenly a boy ran past her.

“Wait!” Cerys said. “Where are you going?”
“It’s time for the Old Car Race, of course!” said the boy. “A thousand years ago everyone had a car, but it was bad for our planet. So now we go around with zip wires between the tree houses. It’s great fun and the world is much greener and quieter now. Each year we think about the old times and we have a race in the forest. I’m in the race but I don’t understand old cars! So I’m quite worried.”

At home, Cerys’ hobby was go-karting and she wanted to have an adventure.
“I think it’s your lucky day”, she said to the boy. “I come from the twenty-first century and I know a lot about old cars. I can help you. Would you like that?”

At first the boy looked very surprised but then he smiled. “We haven’t got much time. Follow me!” They ran through the forest and soon they were at the race. Cerys was amazed – there was so much to see! Lots of people wanted to have lunch before the race. In a small tree house next to the road, there was food for everyone. But this food wasn’t normal. Cerys saw blue bananas, flower-flavoured milkshakes and “leaf pizza”. She wanted to try all of it but the boy said “We’ve only got five minutes! Come on, we have to go to our car.”

When Cerys saw the old car, she was a bit scared because it looked dangerous. It was brown and dirty, the windows were broken and the wheels were flat.

“Isn’t it beautiful?” said the boy happily. “I think we’re going to win. OK, you’re the driver. Let’s go!” Cerys looked at her timewatch. One minute to go. Should she take a chance? It was now or never! So she got into the car and the adventure began.
