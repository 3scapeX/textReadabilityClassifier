Karla: That’s it! Let’s send a music request.
Gillian: A music request? What do you mean?
Karla: Well, we can write an email to the radio station. We’ll ask them to play a song by Linus May for Charlie. He’s his favourite singer, isn’t he?
Gillian: He is! Hey, what a great idea! Have you ever sent a music request?
Karla: Yes, I have. For my uncle. It’s easy: You just have to write an email to DJ Rasta at Radio Camden.
Gillian: Good idea! Let’s do it!
Karla: But we’ll have to phone Charlie and tell him to listen to the radio.
Gillian: OK, here is what we’ll do: First we’ll write the email, then we’ll phone Charlie and tell him to listen to Radio Camden tomorrow afternoon.
Karla: And we can send him a get well card, too.
Gillian: Great, let’s do that!
