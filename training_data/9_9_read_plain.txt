Uluru/Ayers Rock

Ayers Rock or Uluru is in the middle of the Australian outback and was created over 600 million years ago. It stands 348 m above the flat desert and is almost as tall as the Empire State Building in New York City. The rock is 3.6 km long and 1.9 km wide. It is made of sandstone and changes its colour during the day, depending on how the sun shines on it. Sometimes it looks brown, in the early morning and early evening it looks red.
The rock was discovered in 1873 by the Australian explorer William Gosse. He named it Ayers Rock. The Aborigines call it Uluru. It is a holy place for the Anangu tribe of Aboriginal people who have been in the area for around 10,000 years. In the year 2002 the rock was officially named Uluru/Ayers Rock.
Uluru/Ayers Rock is a major tourist attraction and some visitors even climb the rock. It is a long and steep hike to the top where it can be very windy. The Anangu donâ€™t climb Uluru and they wish that visitors respect their culture by not climbing this holy place.
