At the doctor’s

In the waiting room:
Charlie: Ow! This hurts. I can’t move my leg at all.
Rajiv: Huh! You’ve only bruised your knee, that’s all.
Charlie: But it hurts! And it’s swollen. Look!
Rajiv: The doctor will put a bandage or something on it. I’m sure you’ll be able to play football again soon.
Receptionist: Charlie Batson? Doctor Thompson will see you now.

In the surgery:
Dr Thompson: Now, what’s the problem?
Charlie: I think I’ve broken my knee. I was playing football yesterday and I fell. Now my knee really hurts.
Dr Thompson: Let me see. Does this hurt?
Charlie: Ouch!
Dr Thompson: Ah, I see. We’ll have to take an X-ray of your knee so we can see what the problem is. The X-ray room is the second door on the right. I’ll be with you in a few minutes.

Later:
Dr Thompson: OK, Charlie. Your knee isn’t broken, just bruised. I’ll give you a prescription for some cream and put a bandage on your knee. And listen: You mustn’t play football for two weeks.
Charlie: Two weeks? But we’ve got a match against Hendon School next Saturday …
