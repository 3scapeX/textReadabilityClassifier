My best friend is Charlie. He is eleven years old. He has got black hair and brown eyes. 
He loves football and his favourite football club is Arsenal FC. I like football, too and sometimes we play in the park. Charlie and his sisters Josephine and Sharon live in Camden with their parents. Charlie has got a goldfish called Fritz. Fritz lives in a castle. Charlie listens to hip hop and his favourite band is Loophole. Sometimes we listen to music on Charlie’s MP3 player. He has got a lot of hip hop music. Charlie is always hungry! He likes burgers, pizza and chips. His mum says salad is much better but Charlie does not listen to her. 
He cannot stand salad. Charlie’s favourite food is pizza and his favourite drink is chocolate milkshake.
