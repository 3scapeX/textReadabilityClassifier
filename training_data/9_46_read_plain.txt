It is all about global warming

GLOBAL WARMING
The temperature on earth is controlled by the sun. Rays from the sun are sent to earth. The earth is warmed by these rays. For thousands of years, most of the heat went back into the atmosphere, so it didn’t become too hot on earth.
But now there are more and more gases like CO2 in the atmosphere. Most of these “greenhouse gases” are produced by cars, factories and homes. The gases stop the heat so that it can’t leave the earth’s atmosphere anymore.
So more and more of the heat stays in the earth’s atmosphere. That is the reason why it is getting warmer and warmer on earth. This is called “global warming” and has bad effects for everyone.
