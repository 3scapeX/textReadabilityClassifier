Gail
My name is Gail. I am 12 years old and I am from Kirkcaldy in Scotland. I go to a boarding school. That means that I live and sleep at my school and only come home for the holidays. Our school uniform is a green sweatshirt, a white shirt and a green and red skirt. School starts at quarter to nine, lunch is at half past twelve and school finishes at four o’clock. I play hockey once a week and I often go to the cinema with my friends. My favourite subjects are English and drama. I am a member of the school drama club – our next play is Alice in Wonderland. I have to be in bed by nine. But I often talk to my friends for some time before I go to sleep.

Tobias
My name is Tobias and I am 12 years old. I am from Toronto and I go to Summerhill School in England. Summerhill School is a boarding school and it is very special. I can decide which lessons I want to go to. I like science, geography and English. They are my favourite subjects and I always go to the lessons. I don’t like maths but I sometimes go because it helps me with my science lessons. I don’t have to wear a school uniform. Normally I wear jeans and a T-shirt. We don’t usually have homework so in the afternoons I play with my friends.
I sometimes go to bed late and sometimes early.
