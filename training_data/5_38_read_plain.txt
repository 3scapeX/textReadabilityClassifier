This is Derek’s worst birthday ever. He feels so depressed. He walks slowly back home. He doesn’t have any presents, or a birthday cake. When he goes into his house, everything is dark and quiet. Suddenly the light goes on, and all of Derek’s friends, his parents and his grandmother are there! “Surprise!” they shout together. Derek can’t believe it – Kate the cat, Matt the mouse, Hannah the horse, Lizzie the lion, Pete the parrot and his choir are there. The choir sings “Happy birthday” to Derek, and his friends give him lots of presents and a fantastic cake. “Now I understand – it was a big trick. I’m so happy that you are all here!” says Derek, “Thank you so much. This is the best birthday ever!”
