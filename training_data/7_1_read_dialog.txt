Friday evening

Gillian: Mum, we are so hungry. What’s for dinner tonight?
Mrs Collins: Well, I haven’t done any shopping this week. So there isn’t anything in the fridge to cook for you. But we could go out for dinner. The last time we went out was ages ago.
Gillian: Great idea. Let’s go to Burger Queen. That’s my favourite place! They’ve got some really delicious burgers on the menu – and it’s not very expensive.
Mrs Collins: But the weather is so beautiful today and you can’t sit outside there. It’s too hot and noisy inside. And you eat too many hamburgers and chips anyway. What would you like, Charlie? Do you know any other good places to eat?
Charlie: Well, I’m not sure. We could try that new pizza place – Pizza World.
Gillian: Sorry, but I really don’t want any pizza today. I’m going to have some at Dad’s house tomorrow.
Mrs Collins: Oh, Gillian! OK, then why don’t we go to that pub on Westbourne Street? It’s called the Windsor Castle, I think. They’ve got great food and you can sit outside. I’m sure they’ll have something you like. The salads taste really good there …
Gillian: Salad? Salad is boring! 
Charlie: But you don’t have to order a salad. There are other things on the menu. I’ve been there with my family. It’s quite nice.
Mrs Collins: What do you think, Gillian? Would you like to go there? Or have you got any other ideas?
Gillian: I really fancy some Indian food tonight. Something that’s hot and spicy! Can we please order some takeaway food from Bengal Tiger, Mum? We don’t have to buy any drinks and we can have some ice cream for dessert. What do you think, Charlie?
Charlie: Takeaway sounds good to me. And we could watch a film afterwards.
Mrs Collins: OK then. But you two have to phone and order the takeaway. Here’s the menu. Let’s have a look …
