Rabbit-proof Fence

Rabbit-Proof Fence is set in Australia in 1931. 
It tells the story of three girls: sisters Molly and Daisy and their cousin Gracie, who are taken away from their parents by the government. They are brought to Moore River Native Settlement, over 2,000 kilometres away from their home. There they are forced to go to school and to be trained as servants.
The girls despise Moore River and want to return to their families. Led by Molly – at 14 the oldest of the girls – they flee from the settlement and start to walk the long distance home.
To get there they follow the rabbit-proof 
fence – originally built to keep rabbits out of Western Australia – for more than 2,400 kilometres. The walk takes them nine weeks.
During their journey the girls are followed by a white man from the government called A.O. Neville and a black tracker. Their task is to bring the girls back to the settlement. They are able to lead Gracie away from the other two girls and capture her. She is taken back to Moore River, but the sisters Molly and Daisy manage to return home.
