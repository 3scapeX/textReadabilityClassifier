LONDON ZOO: THE GREAT ESCAPE!

On this day … in 1965, Goldie the golden eagle escaped from his home at London Zoo. A keeper was cleaning Goldie’s cage, when Goldie flew away. Maybe the keeper left the door open. Goldie left his good friend Regina behind − but he was free!
He went to Regent’s Park and he visited Tottenham Court Road, Euston and Camden Town, too. Lots of Londoners came to see him in the park. The people at London Zoo tried very hard to get Goldie back. They even asked the British Navy to help.
Goldie was happy. He spent time in the park and avoided capture … until he got very hungry. He saw a tasty rabbit and went to eat it … but it was a trap! A keeper jumped on Goldie and finally caught him. After 12 days of freedom in London, the keepers took Goldie home − back to London Zoo. He had a great holiday and was happy to see his friend Regina again!
Naughty Goldie escaped again in December 1965, but only for 4 days this time.
