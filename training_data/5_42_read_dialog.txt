Charlie: Mum, the summer holidays start soon and we haven’t made any plans yet.
Mrs Batson: Yes, you’re right. Your dad and I had so much to do, we just didn’t have time to 
think about it.
Mr Batson: That’s true. So, where would you like to go?
Sharon: I’d like to fly to Africa and see lots of wild animals. That would be fun!
Mrs Batson: I know, sweetheart, but it’s just too expensive for us. Think about a nice place in Britain. What about Brighton?
Charlie: Oh no, not Brighton again! Scotland is great. There are mountains and we could visit Loch Ness. Maybe we can even find Nessie.
Josephine: But Charlie, think about the weather. It’s often wet and cold in Scotland. Why can’t we go to Cornwall? There are really nice beaches along the coast.
Sharon: Oh yeah, I love swimming and building sandcastles!
Mr Batson: I agree with you, Josie. Cornwall is a great place for a holiday. We could visit Land’s End and other famous sights.
Mrs Batson: Fantastic! And you get really good food there and the people are so friendly. 
What do you think, Charlie?
Charlie: Well, it’s OK. But only if I can have an ice cream every day …
