Animals in Australia: Corals

Corals are marine animals. The baby coral looks like a tiny jellyfish. It floats around in the water until it finds a place to attach to, usually a coral reef. It lands and starts to build itself a shell. This is made of calcium carbonate, also known as limestone. 
Corals need tiny animals – the zooxanthellae. They live on and inside the corals. These animals are food for the corals and give them their colour. Different corals like different zooxanthellae and have different colours.
The Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia contains the world’s largest collection of coral reefs. It is home to 400 types of coral as well as all kinds of fish, turtles, sea snakes, snails, starfish, whales, dolphins and other marine animals.
