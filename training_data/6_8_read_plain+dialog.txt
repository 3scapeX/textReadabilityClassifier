Gillian is at home. Her mother is at work. Gillian is doing her homework and listening to the news on the radio. The newsreader is talking about a tiger from London Zoo. But the tiger isn’t in the zoo now – it is walking in the streets of London! Gillian is very frightened.

Newsreader: … and the police are looking for it now. The keeper went to the cage at five o’clock and the tiger wasn’t there. It must be somewhere in the streets of London.
Gillian: Help! Perhaps it’s in our street! Perhaps it’s walking outside our house! … Oooh, where’s Mum? Why isn’t she back yet? And where are George and Rob?
Newsreader: The keeper says that the tiger ate at three thirty and it’s always sleepy after its meal … so perhaps it’s sleeping in a garden somewhere.
Gillian: Oooh, perhaps it’s sleeping in our garden … Oh dear! What’s that noise?
Mrs Collins: Hello, Gillian. What’s the matter? You look frightened.
Gillian: Oh, Mum. Quick! Close the door! They’re looking for a tiger from the zoo. It’s in our street!
Mrs Collins: Oh, Gillian, don’t be silly!
Newsreader: It’s six fifteen. News just in – the tiger is in Kensington Gardens. It is sleeping under a tree. The police are trying to catch it now …
