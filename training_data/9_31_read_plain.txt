What a day

by Jamila Edi
This afternoon my family and I were in a traffic jam for nearly an hour. Our car was right behind a truck full of loads of the saddest animals I’ve ever seen. There were hundreds of chickens with their little feet stuck through the wire fence, and they had bloody faces and broken wings, too. And then they all looked at me. It was like they were asking me for help or something. It was horrible!
Later, when we stopped at a restaurant, I read the word “chicken” on the menu and I saw those eyes again. I just had macaroni cheese.
I’ve always loved chicken nuggets and hamburgers, but after today I really don’t think I can eat meat anymore.
