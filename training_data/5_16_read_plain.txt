Seller: Hi, can I help you?
George: Hi. I’m looking for a new T-shirt.
Seller: Any special event?
George: Yes, I’m going to a birthday party.
Seller: OK. What colour would you like?
George: I’m not sure … red maybe … or purple. Black would be OK, too.
Seller: Well, purple is a good colour. Let’s see. Here are three very nice 
T-shirts and they’re really cheap.
George: I’m not sure about the purple one because it’s got a dog on it.
Seller: Well, this black T-shirt has got a skateboard on it.
George: I don’t know. What about the green one behind you?
Seller: That’s got a G on it.
George: Perfect. Like G for George. How much is it?
Seller: It’s £11.50.
George: That’s too expensive. I’ve only got £10.
Seller: OK then. You can have it for £10.
George: Thanks a lot. Bye.
Seller: Thanks, bye. And have a great party.
