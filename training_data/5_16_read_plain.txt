I like breakfast. It is my favourite meal. Before school I haven’t got much time so I only eat cereal and toast. I drink tea and orange juice. At the weekend the whole family gets together. We have a traditional Russian breakfast.

Hugo
I go to school in the afternoon so I don’t get up very early. I make breakfast for me and my two little brothers. We have tortillas, eggs and salsa. We also eat beans and chicken with tomato sauce. We always have a lot of fruit, too: mango, papaya and so on.

Antonia
I eat a lot for breakfast because I am always hungry when I wake up. I eat bread rolls with cheese, ham or salami. Sometimes I also eat jam or honey or chocolate spread. I drink tea and apple juice.

Sarah
I get up very early. I have to take a bus because my school is not very close to my house. So I don’t eat breakfast at home. When I get to school we all have breakfast together. We have yoghurt and muesli, sandwiches and chocolate milk.
