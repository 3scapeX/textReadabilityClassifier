Rajiv’s curry party

Rajiv is a great cook. It’s Saturday and he has invited some friends for an Indian meal: Gillian, Charlie, Caroline and Karla. They are making a curry.
Karla: Mmm. Smells good, doesn’t it?
Rajiv: I always cook it like my grandmother did. When she came here from India, she brought lots of spices with her.
Charlie: I thought you could buy everything at the supermarket.
Rajiv: Well, now you can. But when she came here, people knew nothing about Indian food. Now there are lots of Indian supermarkets and I can buy everything I need.
Gillian: How many onions do you want? Ow, my eyes are watering. I can’t see a thing … ouch! – Now I’ve cut my finger.
Caroline: Poor you! Here. Hold your finger under the tap. Then it won’t hurt.
Gillian: Thanks, Caroline.
Caroline: Do you want some of this extra-hot chilli paste, Rajiv?
Rajiv: Sure. We like our curry hot, you know.
Caroline: Mmm, you have to try it. It’s delicious!
Gillian: Well, it burns your mouth a bit.
Karla: Phew, it’s sooo hot! I need a glass of water.
Charlie: Don’t! That will make it worse. Eat some bread.
Rajiv: Looks like we put in too much chilli paste, doesn’t it, Caroline?
Caroline: Why don’t we … ?
