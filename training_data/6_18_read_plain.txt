It is the end of January and Rajiv and Charlie are in London’s Chinatown. They are watching the Chinese New Year parade. There are many people, and there is a lot to see: colourful costumes, scary dragons and a lot of bands playing music. In the evening there are even fireworks. All the shops are decorated with little red flags. Food stalls are selling Chinese prawn crackers, noodles and other delicious things.
“Look, Charlie. We can buy shrimp dumplings! … Oh no, they’re too expensive.”

The boys follow the parade. Rajiv suddenly stops. “Hey, I stepped on something. Hm, what’s this?” It is something red, an envelope.
Rajiv opens the envelope. “Wow, there’re £30 in it! You know what? I’m going to keep it.” Charlie is quiet for a minute. “Ah, no, Rajiv. You can’t keep it. It belongs to a Chinese boy or girl. You know that Chinese children get red envelopes from their family and friends with good-luck money for the New Year. We’re going to give the money back.”

“But Charlie, there’s no one to give it back to! And I can buy a cool T-shirt. And you can buy a new computer game.” “Rajiv, what if someone sees us? Look, there’s a police officer over there. I think he’s looking at us.” The boys don’t know what to do. After a minute Rajiv says, “OK. Let’s see if we can find the owner.”
