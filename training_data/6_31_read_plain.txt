Tom was a good student. But one he started arriving late for lessons. 
He told his teacher that he wasn’t able to get up early enough and so he always missed the bus. At the next parent-teacher meeting Tom’s teacher talked to his parents about this. They were very surprised. Tom always left home early enough to get to school by bus.

The teacher talked to some students who took the same bus to school. They told him that Tom didn’t go to school by bus anymore. He walked the three miles to school! They didn’t know why. Perhaps he liked going to school on foot.
The teacher talked to Tom again – but not in front of the class. At first Tom didn’t want to tell him anything. Then he started to cry because he was so embarrassed. There was an older boy from school who waited for him at the bus stop every morning. He was big and mean and Tom was afraid of him. The bully took Tom’s bus money and so Tom had to get to school on foot.

The teacher reported everything to the headteacher. Now this boy doesn’t bully Tom anymore!
