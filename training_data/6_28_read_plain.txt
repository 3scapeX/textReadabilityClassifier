Why can’t I do what I want? Mum always knows better. I’ve got cool new jeans but I must wear those ugly trousers for Grandmas birthday.

I bet Sheree doesn’t have to wear what Mum says. Charlie can watch TV after ten, I can’t. Rules, rules, rules in our house – I hate them!!! I can go to the youth club disco – great. But I always have to be home by eight.

Then there’s homework! Mum says that I must not listen to music when I do my homework. And I have to do it before I can go out or play computer games. I wonder what Sheree could do when she was twelve. I think Mum is worse than most of my teachers!
