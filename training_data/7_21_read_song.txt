The city-village rap

Living in a city,
For me it is just great,
I’m always busy,
Catching the bus
To the shops or the cinema.
City life yeah –
I like living this way.

Living in a village,
For me it is just great,
Go running and climbing,
Spend time outside
Ssh! It’s so quiet.
Village life yeah –
I like living this way.

Living in a city,
Or the village life,
We’re all the same,
Chatting and laughing,
Having a great time
Having friends yeah –
Give me a high five!
