1. I felt bored this afternoon. I thought “What about a walk around London?” I opened the door of the cage and walked away!

2. Then I went swimming in the canal – but the water was so dirty, ugh!

3. I walked to the park but that was terrible. There were a lot of people there. I wanted to say hello but everyone ran away.

4. Then I wanted to go to Madame Tussauds. I tried to buy a ticket but they didn’t let me in.

5. Suddenly I was very hungry and I ate a tourist’s sandwich. I asked him first, of course.

6. Then I looked at the lovely shops.

7. After that I felt really tired so I slept in Kensington Gardens. Then the police brought me back to the zoo.
