YHA Summer camps

This year there are 23 camps waiting to welcome you and give you the best week of your summer. 
There really is something for everyone.
Most YHA summer camps are for 10 – 16 year olds. 
Remember to check the age groups for each week at the camp – just click on the activities.
Our camps are great places to make new friends, but you can also come with up to three friends.
Each camp gives you a week of action and adventure with a unique atmosphere which truly makes the summer camp experience what it is – a fantastic week shared with friends – old and new.
