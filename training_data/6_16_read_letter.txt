Dear DJ Rasta,

We’d like to make a music request for Charlie Batson. He’s ill with chickenpox. We miss him and we hope he’ll get well soon. Charlie is a big fan of Linus May. We want to cheer him up. So could you please play one of Linus May’s songs tomorrow afternoon? Thanks a lot!

Best wishes
Karla Marshall and Gillian Collins

PS: We really love your radio show!
