Dreamtime stories

Aborigines believe that the world and everything on it was made by “ancestor spirits”. These spirits arrived a very long time ago, some from the sky, some from across the water, and some from the ground. Aborigines call this period of time the “Dreamtime”. This Dreamtime story explains how – as the Aborigines believe – the sun and the stars were made.
A long time ago it was very, very dark. It was always night. An emu and a crane started to fight over the emu’s eggs. The emu cracked the eggs. The crane kicked the eggs up into the sky. There was an explosion. The yellow yolk of the eggs became the sun. The pieces of eggshell became the stars. And from then on, the world was full of light and warmth.
