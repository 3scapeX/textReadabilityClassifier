A musical

King Mufasa is a powerful lion and the king of the Pridelands in Africa. He is a very good king and all the animals look up to him. Mufasa has a son, Simba. He will be the next king when his father dies. But Simbaâ€™s uncle, Scar, is jealous: He wants to become the new king.
Scar tries to kill Simba but Mufasa rescues his son. Then Scar tries to kill Simba a second time: He takes him to a valley. In the valley Scar and some hyenas scare all the other animals. The animals run away in panic and trample down everything. Mufasa saves Simba again, but Mufasa dies and Scar makes Simba believe that he has killed his father. Scar tells Simba to run away.
Simba runs away and almost dies. Some other animals find him and they stay together. 
Later Simba meets his friend Nala. Nala tells Simba that Scar is the king now. She asks him to come back because he is the true king. Simba returns to the Pridelands and meets his uncle Scar. Scar tells Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Simba. They fight and Scar dies. Now Simba is the lion king with his new wife, Nala.
