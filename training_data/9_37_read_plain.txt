A different kind of camp

About 60 per cent of Germans are overweight and two thirds of Americans. Many of them are teenagers. In the United States, Canada and throughout Europe there are special camps called weight loss camps or “fat farms”. Children and teenagers are sent there during the summer to lose weight. Many of the American camps have existed since the 1950s.
In the past these camps put children on low-calorie diets and made them do lots and lots of exercise, but one problem was the yo-yo effect: Most children put their weight back on very quickly. Today programmes like yoga, meditation and deep-breathing exercises are offered in addition to traditional exercises. 
Camp life is still hard. Chocolate, hamburgers, popcorn, pizza and other kinds of junk food are banned from the plates. Instead there is a diet of fruit, vegetables, brown bread, fish and other healthy foods. Many weight loss camps teach the teenagers how to cook and choose healthy meals in order to change their eating habits. This way they try to make sure that the weight doesn’t return immediately.
