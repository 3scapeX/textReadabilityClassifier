People and places – Aborigines

About 50,000 years ago the islands in the north of Australia were much nearer to the islands of New Guinea in South-East Asia. The people travelled from island to island in canoes or on rafts. But about 8,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age, the sea divided the islands of Australia and New Guinea. Australia was now a continent, surrounded by water. The Aborigines, who probably came from South-East Asia to Australia, were left on the new continent.
The Aborigines lived off the land and hunted, picked berries and fished. Each group of Aborigines lived together and spoke their own language. There were about 600 different languages. The Aborigines had and still have legends and stories about how everything was made. Today they call this time the “Dreamtime”.
When the first British settlers arrived in 1788, there were at least 300,000 Aborigines. But a hundred years later, there were fewer than 100,000. Diseases and alcohol that the settlers brought with them, and fighting between whites and Aborigines were the reasons. Their land was taken away from them, and they had to move to places where they couldn’t farm or live in their traditional way.
Between 1869 and 1969 about 100,000 Aboriginal children were taken away from their families to turn them into “good” Australians by educating them “properly”. Today these children are called the “Stolen Generations”.
Now there are about 500,000 Aborigines but most of them are very poor. Things are getting better slowly: Their traditional culture is now taught in schools and they can get money for the land which was taken away from them. In February 2008 the Australian government apologized for the wrongs that had been done to Aborigines and said sorry to the “Stolen Generations”.
