Hello, my name is Caroline. I’m eleven. I’ve got a twin brother, George. He’s funny. We’re from Manchester. We’re new in Camden. We live in a small house with our mum and dad. I’ve got a rabbit and a dog. My rabbit’s name is Daisy and my dog’s name is Patch. Patch likes popcorn and I like popcorn, too. My favourite food is pizza and my favourite drink is lemonade. I like inline skating, football, dancing and music. I’ve got a blue MP3 player. There are lots of posters in my room. Bye.
