Hi Claire,
Thanks for your email. How are you? London is great. I have got three new friends already â€” one girl and two boys! Their names are Gillian, Charlie and Rajiv. They all like football. They sometimes play in the park. Gillian likes rock, pop and hip hop, and we listen to music together. Charlie and Rajiv like music, too. Rajiv can even play the guitar. (I have to tell you: He is so nice!) Gillian and I like fantasy stories and we often talk about them. Gillian reads a lot of other books, too. And they all like pets. Charlie has got a goldfish. His name is Fritz. Gillian has got a cat. Her name is Mrs Killmouskey. I think that is a funny name. Tomorrow is my first day at my new school. I am so nervous!
