“I’m not going to say it again, Doug,” Mrs. Madison called up the steps. “Either you pick up your room, or I’m going to throw all of your things in the garbage!” Doug knew she wouldn’t do it. He heard the same threat1 every Saturday. It was always on Saturday because Mom didn’t call Saturday Saturday. She called it “Pick-up-your-room-day.” Unless guests were coming on a different day – then “Pick-up-your-room-day” could be any day. But usually it was Saturday. Doug half-heartedly put some books in his bookshelf – backwards. ‘Mom will put them in the right way later,’ he thought to himself. ‘She always does. Why should I bother?’ “Doug! Are you picking up?” the voice called up the stairs again. “Because if you’re not, then I guess that means you don’t need all those things.” “Yeah, Mom,” Doug answered. “What did you say? I should send all those toys and games to Africa. You know, Doug, there are children in this world who don’t have ANYTHING to play with, NOTHING,” the voice went on. “Doug? Answer me!” ‘How can I answer her when she didn’t ask me anything?’ Doug thought to himself
“Doug!?”
“Yes, Mom…”
“So think about that. If you can’t take care of your things and pick them up once a week, then
I’ll just send them to children who will appreciate3 them. There are enough kids…”
Doug closed his bedroom door and didn’t hear the rest of his mom’s sentence. But he didn’t
need to hear it. He already knew what she was saying.
“There are enough kids who would be happy to have just one of your toys,” Doug imitated his
mother’s voice. She couldn’t hear him with his door closed. He pushed some clothes under
his bed, but on second thought he picked them up and threw them in the clothes hamper4.
They were still clean, but it was much easier to throw them in the hamper than hang them up
or fold them. “They have to be washed sometime anyway,” he said to himself. Now there was
room under the bed for his Legos. He used his right foot to push them under it. ‘No, better use
my left foot,’ he thought. ‘I need to practice with my left foot for soccer.’
Next Doug looked at his desk and thought it didn’t look so bad. There was a note from school
for his parents there, but it was already a week old so it certainly wasn’t important anymore.
He threw it away. He stuffed5 some other things into the desk drawer and was satisfied.
He moved the other things on the floor (bottles, model airplane, boxing gloves) into the
corners. ‘There,’ he thought. ‘Finished.’
Just then his door flew open and the voice started again. “I want everything off the floor so that
I can vacuum6. If there’s anything left on the floor…”
“You can vacuum now, Mom. I’m done. Bye, I’m going to Kevin’s,” Doug informed his mother.
Mrs. Madison stood in the middle of Doug’s room with the vacuum cleaner in her hands and
her mouth hanging open. “Doug,” she began and then stopped again. Doug’s mother took a
deep breath and started again. “Doug, I’m taking all of these things, the things in the corners,
under your bed and on your desk and sending them to children who will appreciate them.”
Doug was tired of hearing this. Why did his mom always just talk and never do anything? He
knew nothing would happen to him, so he said, “Okay, Mom. Send the stuff7 to Africa.” Then he
left his room, ran down the stairs and out the front door.
Mrs. Madison was still standing in her son’s room. She closed her mouth and thought about
what her son had said to her. That’s when she made a decision. She picked up the boxing
gloves, took the books out of the shelf that were in backwards, scooped up8 the Legos under the
bed and collected the toys from the corners. After carrying everything downstairs, Mrs. Madison began to wrap all the toys in brown paper. The more she thought about her son’s behavior9, the
angrier she became and the faster she wrapped. Next she tried to think of all the places in the
world where terrible things were happening. Where had that Tsunami happened? Where were
the tribes10 fighting? Where were the last hurricanes and fires and mudslides11?
‘The Internet,’ thought Mrs. Madison. ‘I can’t think straight. The Internet will give me the
answers.’
After 15 minutes, Mrs. Madison had a list of ten places around the world. She quickly wrote the
places on the packages like this:
To a child
Banda Aceh, Sumatra
Indonesia
She wrote Doug Madison and their address in the top corner. Then she carried all the packages
to her car and left for the post office. When she got to the second corner, she realized how silly
she was being. How would the packages ever arrive? Would the postman walk around with the
package until he found a child? And how much would it cost her?
She just wanted to teach her son a lesson12, but she saw that it didn’t make sense to send the
packages. Instead she turned around and drove back home. At home she put the packages in a
big plastic garbage bag and hid them in a dark corner of the garage. ‘I’ll let Doug think that I
sent them. We’ll see if he learns his lesson.’
“Mom!” Doug shouted from his bedroom that evening. “Mom, I can’t find my football! Mom!”
Mrs. Madison was in the kitchen when she heard Doug calling her. She put down the knife and
the potato she was cutting and walked slowly to the steps. Before she talked, she took a deep
breath and tried to sound calm.
“Yes, Doug? Did you call me?”
This time Doug shouted even louder, “I can’t find my football!!”
“I know you can’t find your football. I sent it to Africa,” Mrs. Madison said calmly and walked
back to the kitchen. She didn’t wait for Doug’s reaction, but before she got to the kitchen she
could already hear Doug running down the steps.
He burst into the kitchen and said, “And my boxing gloves? And my Legos?”
Mrs Madison took another deep breath. It seemed like her plan was working. “Let’s see… the
boxing gloves went to El Salvador and the Legos to… umm… Indonesia.”
Doug couldn’t believe his ears. His mom really did it? She sent all his stuff away? At first Doug
wanted to yell at his mom, but then he thought: all the stuff would come back to him. There
was no way any postman in the world would deliver a package that didn’t have a name on it but
only a city and country. So he smiled and said, “Good, Mom. And my model airplane?”
Now Mrs. Madison couldn’t believe her ears! Doug should be yelling now. He should be angry
at her. He should want all his things back right now. He should promise to always pick up his
bedroom.
The next afternoon after school, Doug waited for the postman. He was sure the first packages
would come back already. Nothing. ‘Maybe the postman hasn’t come to our house yet,’ he
thought. ‘I’ll walk around the neighborhood and look for him.’
When Doug got back to his house 30 minutes later, he hadn’t found the postman and there was
still no package for him. But there was an upset mother and an angry father. “Where have you
been?” they both shouted at the same time.
“Mrs. Washington will be here in 5 minutes to pick you up for soccer practice. And you’re not
even dressed!” his mother yelled.
Doug simply answered, “Then you can take me.”
Now it was his father’s turn13. “NO! Your mother is leaving NOW for the parent meeting at
school. Mrs. Monroe is coming. And I’m leaving NOW for a meeting at the office.”
Mrs. Madison rushed out the door when she heard a horn beep but came back in two seconds later and grabbed14 her purse. “See you for supper!” she called over her shoulder. Then she
was back one more time. “Don’t forget the post office, honey!” she called to her husband. “The
Christmas cards have to go out today!” Finally she got into Mrs. Monroe’s car and drove away.
Doug’s father was grumbling15 under his breath16. He took the car keys and left without saying
goodbye to Doug. He was already late and now he had to stop by the post office, too. When
he got in the car he saw the pile for the post office. ‘Oh well,’ he thought. ‘It will only take a
minute or two.’ At the post office he scooped up everything on the seat next to him. He didn’t
notice the small brown package
that was with the letters. But the
clerk in the post office noticed
it. She tried to ask Mr. Madison
about the package with the strange
address, but he was too busy
looking at the clock. “Should I send
this, too?” she asked him.
Without looking down, Mr. Madison
said impatiently17, “Yes, everything.
Send it. I’m in a hurry.”
“Here, Doug. Here’s another one for
you!”
“Okay, wait. My pile’s falling down!”
“Give this one to your cousin. He’s
sitting over there.”
“I can’t see him. There’s too much wrapping paper18 on the floor. And all these piles of
presents!”
It was Christmas Day and the Madisons were celebrating with their whole family. Grandmas
and grandpas, aunts and uncles and all the cousins were there. The day started early at church
and then everyone came to Doug’s house to open presents. That took a long time because there
were so many people and so many presents for each person.
At lunchtime the table was full of delicious-smelling foods. Everyone ate until they were
stuffed19 – but they left a little room for dessert, too!
“Doug! Doug!!! Will you please come and get your presents from the living room!” It was the day
after Christmas and Mrs. Madison was trying to tidy up the house again. ‘The holidays are hard
work,’ she thought. “Doug, if you leave these presents down here one more day, I’ll…” Mrs.
Madison couldn’t finish her sentence because the doorbell rang just then.
“I’ll get it!” Doug yelled and ran down the stairs. “Coming!” he yelled to the person on the other
side of the door. “Yes?” he shouted as he opened the door. It was the postman. He gave Doug
a thick toy catalog. “It wouldn’t fit in the mailbox,” the man said. “And here’s the rest of your
mail.”
Doug thanked him and closed the door. He couldn’t wait to look at the new toy catalog. His
birthday was in March and it was time to start a list. He handed the rest of the mail to his mom
and went to the living room to write his birthday list.
“Mom! Can you bring me a pen?” Doug shouted, but his mom was already there. “Did you bring
me a pen? And some paper, too.”
Mrs. Madison didn’t say anything. “Mom? Did you hear me?”
Mrs. Madison handed Doug a letter. When Doug looked at the envelope, he understood why his
mom didn’t say anything. He was confused, too. The name and address on the airmail envelope
were his, but the letter was from Indonesia. He didn’t know anyone in Indonesia.
Doug ripped it open and found a short letter.
To Doug,
Thank you for the package. I like the blocks very much. The Red Cross lady is helping
me to write this letter. She says you sent the blocks to me. How did you know about
me? It was the best present ever. Thank you. Here is a picture of my house for you. I
drew it.
From Agung
“Cool,” was all Doug could say at first. “Cool, a letter from Indonesia.”
Nobody said anything for a while. Then Doug asked, “Mom? I don’t get it. Did you really send all
those packages?”
“The packages? No. The ones from your bedroom… They’re… I put them all in the garage.
I didn’t send them. I don’t understand. They’re all in the garage,” Mrs. Madison said as she
thought about that Saturday morning about one month ago.
Mrs. Madison walked out to the garage and Doug followed her. In the corner was the big, black
garbage bag. They carried it into the house and opened it on the living room floor. All the
brown packages were still in the bag.
“What in the world are you two doing?” Doug’s father asked as he walked into the room and
saw them on the floor with the packages. They explained what had happened and gave him the
letter from Agung.
“Look, there’s another piece of paper here, too. It’s from the Red Cross.” Mr. Madison quickly
read the letter to them:
Dear Doug,
Agung was so happy about the Legos! That was such an excellent idea to send the package to
“A Child” here. The children in Banda Aceh don’t have much to be happy about. Was this a school
project perhaps? I would love to hear more about it and about you. Thank you again. There
should be more young people in the world like you!
Sincerely,
Mary Lincoln
Red Cross
