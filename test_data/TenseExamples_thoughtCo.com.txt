I am looking at my piece of pizza. I am watching pepperoni glisten. It is my third day at the new school and I am sitting at a table next to the bathrooms. I am eating lunch with the blond girls with the pink sweaters, the girls who talk incessantly about Harvard even though we're only in the seventh grade. People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. Anyway, tonight, we are having a perfectly balanced supper of fish fingers (essential fatty fish oils), baked beans (lovely roughage) and oven chips (bursting with potato goodness).

As police have never solved the murders, this legend has fascinated the public for the whole of the last century. Researchers have put forward over 100 differrent theories as to the identity of the killer. The story has inspired numerous novels and movies. The real name of "Jack the Ripper" has been the subject of speculation since 1888. But now, experts believe that they have found the identity of the serial killer from the East End of London. Cross hasn't been the subject of much investigation and has appeared only vaguely in census records. We have found out that he gave a false name to police and his real name was Charles Latchmere. 

We will need your help. The Blueskins are bigger and stronger than the Pinkies, and if they have sharp sticks which are longer than ours they will surely defeat us. Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery! said his mother. The school bus will be here in half an hour. Let me make a quick call and then I will join you, if that is all right. The old woman called to Butterbumps. Fool! Give us a song. A long one, I should think. "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" will do nicely. You can set a goal to get better grades; but if you're not planning to go to college, chances are that goal won't have much meaning for you, and you probably won't reach the goal. 'I'll go if you think you can get me to Ogallala,' she said. 'I'll pay you what it's worth to you.'

She's going to attend university and study to become a doctor. We're going to make the presentation next week. She is going to attend the meeting. They aren't going to visit Rome next year. Where am I going to stay?

I was sitting in a taxi, wondering if I had overdressed for the evening when I looked out the window and saw Mom rooting through a Dumpster. I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again. I had some eyeglasses. I was walking down the street when suddenly the prescription ran out. 1492. The teachers told the children that this was when their continent was discovered by human beings. Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them. I met this wonderful girl at Macy's. She was buying clothes and I was putting Slinkies on the escalator. As we were talking outside, it was cold, we were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter. I was hoping we could heal each other. I was hoping we could be raw together. A few days later, I was studying when Auntie Annie called me into the living room. Mark was standing there, frowning at the shining Christmas ornaments. At the very moment that the iceberg struck, the saloon passengers were singing 'A Life on the Ocean Wave'.

I had never flown in an airplane before I went to London. After she had attended college, she became a police officer. They had forgotten the answer until the teacher reminded them. I had attended the event for years without ever having to purchase tickets. He had admitted his fault to her repeatedly. They would have never known the truth without investigating. If I had listened during class, I would have passed the test. If you had understood me, you would not be asking questions. If we had called ahead, we would not have waited. The boss had said it would be a long day. The child had wondered how many stars were in the sky. The student had asked another question. I wished I had returned the item. He wished he had ordered a different meal. We wished we had brought our dog on vacation.

Going to college is expensive. Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. Binx Bolling, the hero of Walker Percy's The Moviegoer, enjoys riding the bus that runs from Gentilly down Elysian Fields and into the French Quarter of New Orleans. I never believe nor disbelieve. If you will excuse my speaking frankly, I mean to observe you closely, and to decide for myself. They cut down elms to build asylums for people driven mad by the cutting down of elms. Shooting paintballs is not an art form. Humor is laughing at what you haven't got when you ought to have it. All talk of winning the people by appealing to their intelligence, of conquering them by impeccable syllogism, is so much moonshine. There are times when parenthood seems nothing but feeding the mouth that bites you. This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.

We did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so.

Try to understand how hard he has been trying to make everything better for his family. I have been painting with a palette knife because I don't like to wash the brushes. I have been waiting. I have been searching. I am a man under the moon, walking the streets of earth until dawn. There's got to be someone for me. The ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together. Garcia might have been surprised by how many scholars have been studying the cultural furniture in the Grateful Dead outback. My friends and I are a little worried because Stacey hasn't been feeling too great lately. But she seems to be coping.

He knew that she had been dreaming that night and he knew what her dreams were about. For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story. I felt like an extraordinary hero. I was only five or six and I had the whole of life in my hands. Even if I had been driving the carriage of the sun I could not have felt any better. The jaws fell, the ears drooped more limply. He had been looking like a dead fish. He now looked like a deader fish, one of last year's, cast up on some lonely beach and left there at the mercy of the wind and tides.

Your mother will be worrying about you, Gertrude. We'll make up extra veils and arm bands, and our members will be waiting to distribute them. She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes. The old will be watching their contemporaries and wondering how long it will be before their turn comes, hoping their bladders will hold out, and the young will be watching the old. In another five hours we will be in a landing-craft racing towards the coast. I wonder where I will be and what I will be doing this time tomorrow. I am ready now. We're going to raise crops here where before it just simply was impossible. You're going to have more grain than you'll know what to do with. Bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am. Will she be coming around the mountain when she comes? She will not be coming around the mountain this afternoon. Hannibal Lecter won't be cooking dinner tonight.
