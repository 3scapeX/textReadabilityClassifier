We are lambs in a den of wolves. We will need your help. The Blueskins are bigger and stronger than the Pinkies, and if they have sharp sticks which are longer than ours they will surely defeat us. Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!' said his mother. 'The school bus will be here in half an hour.' Let me make a quick call and then I will join you, if that is all right. The old woman called to Butterbumps. 'Fool! Give us a song. A long one, I should think. "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" will do nicely. You can set a goal to get better grades; but if you're not planning to go to college, chances are that goal won't have much meaning for you, and you probably won't reach the goal.'I'll go if you think you can get me to Ogallala,' she said. 'I'll pay you what it's worth to you.'

I am looking at my piece of pizza. I am watching pepperoni glisten. It is my third day at the new school and I am sitting at a table next to the bathrooms. I am eating lunch with the blond girls with the pink sweaters, the girls who talk incessantly about Harvard even though we're only in the seventh grade. People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. 'Anyway, tonight, we are having a perfectly balanced supper of fish fingers (essential fatty fish oils), baked beans (lovely roughage) and oven chips (bursting with potato goodness).'

I was sitting in a taxi, wondering if I had overdressed for the evening when I looked out the window and saw Mom rooting through a Dumpster. I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again. I had some eyeglasses. I was walking down the street when suddenly the prescription ran out. 1492. The teachers told the children that this was when their continent was discovered by human beings. Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them. I met this wonderful girl at Macy's. She was buying clothes and I was putting Slinkies on the escalator.

A few days later, I was studying when Auntie Annie called me into the living room. Mark was standing there, frowning at the shining Christmas ornaments. At the very moment that the iceberg struck, the saloon passengers were singing 'A Life on the Ocean Wave'.

Your mother will be worrying about you, Gertrude. We'll make up extra veils and arm bands, and our members will be waiting to distribute them. She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes. The old will be watching their contemporaries and wondering how long it will be before their turn comes, hoping their bladders will hold out, and the young will be watching the old. In another five hours we will be in a landing-craft racing towards the coast. I wonder where I will be and what I will be doing this time tomorrow. I am ready now. We're going to raise crops here where before it just simply was impossible. You're going to have more grain than you'll know what to do with. Bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am.

Try to understand how hard he has been trying to make everything better for his family. I have been painting with a palette knife because I don't like to wash the brushes. I have been waiting. I have been searching. I am a man under the moon, walking the streets of earth until dawn. There's got to be someone for me. The ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together.
