Charlie likes reading and watching films. Then he starts to daydream …
When he watches a western, he wants to be a cowboy. “One day I’ll ride horses. They run really fast! I’d love to live in New Mexico and look after cattle.”
When he reads his Donald Duck comics, he wants to be rich like Donald’s uncle Scrooge. “I’ll work hard and make lots of money. Then I’ll buy a chocolate factory.”
When he watches science fiction films, he wants to be an astronaut. “Then perhaps I’ll be the first man on Jupiter.”
When he reads his sports magazines, he wants to be a famous football player. “I want to play really well and score a lot of goals. Then Arsenal will want to buy me for a billion pounds.”
Sometimes he reads books about heroes from the past. “Robin Hood. He was a cool guy! He took money from the rich and gave it to the poor people. When I grow up, perhaps I’ll be a hero like Robin Hood. It would be great to live in the forest and have adventures.”
