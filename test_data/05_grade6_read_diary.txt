Thursday, 2nd August

Today was GREAT! In the morning I got a postcard from Caroline. She’s so nice. I can’t wait to see her again. Later I phoned Charlie and we met at the market. I found a cool T-shirt. It was cheap so I bought it. In the afternoon we went to a concert for kids in Hyde Park. The entry was free and there were two bands. They were really good. Charlie and I took some photos with our mobiles and danced to the music. I felt so happy. When I came home, Sheree made pizza for us – yummy! I’m proud of my sister.

TERRIBLE Friday, 3rd August

In the morning I had to help in the shop. Dad asked me to clean the shelves. It was so boring and my jeans got dirty. After that I had to help some customers. One man wanted to have kiwis. When I told him we don’t sell kiwis, he got really angry. I can’t stand unfriendly customers. Grandma phoned. She felt lonely and asked me to come to her house. She told me lots of stories. Some were funny but most of them were sad or boring. On my way home I saw Charlie and his family with their caravan. Everyone is going on holiday and I have to stay in London. It’s not fair!
