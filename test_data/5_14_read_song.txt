At seven o’clock
I get up and get dressed.
In the morning
a sandwich is best.

I pack my bag,
it’s half past eight.
I go to school,
sometimes I’m late.

I meet my friends
for lunch at one.
We eat and talk,
it’s always fun.

At quarter past five
I watch TV.
At half past six
I have my tea.

At half past seven
it’s homework time.
I do my homework
and finish by nine.

At twenty to ten
Dad says “Good night”.
It’s very late
but that’s alright.
