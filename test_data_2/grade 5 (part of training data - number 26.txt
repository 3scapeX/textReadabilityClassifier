I live with my mother, my brother and my sister in a flat in Paris. My mother’s boyfriend sometimes lives there as well. The flat has got four rooms. My sister and I have got one room. My brother has got his own bedroom and my mother and her boyfriend have got one bedroom as well. We also have got a living room. We eat, play and watch TV in the living room. There is a table and a big TV. There is a nice kitchen in the flat and a big bathroom. My mother and her boyfriend work a lot so we all have to help at home. I always do the shopping. I normally go to the supermarket around the corner. My brother Alain also helps. He usually takes out the rubbish before he goes to school. My sister Romy sometimes cleans the windows. Alain tidies up his room every Wednesday afternoon. I always empty the dishwasher after school. At the weekend we clean the flat. It’s fun because we all work together. Then we sometimes go for dinner or to the cinema.
