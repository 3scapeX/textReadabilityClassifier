Kentish Town City Farm – looking for volunteers

We are a small farm in Camden with lots of different farm animals: chickens, cows, ducks, goats, horses, pigs and sheep.

Over 20,000 people come here every year to learn about animals, nature and enjoy the farm atmosphere in the city.

We offer different activities for school classes and weekend workshops. And it is all for free.

If you are over the age of eight, you are welcome to help on the farm: Muck out, groom the goats and horses, feed the animals, …

Interested? Then come at 9 am on a Saturday or Sunday (or both) or anytime during the school holidays.
Parents must come in with their child on the first day and fill out a registration form and also have a health and safety talk.
